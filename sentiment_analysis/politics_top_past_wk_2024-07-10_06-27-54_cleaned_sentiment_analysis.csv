Fact check list



 in Trump’s first year in office during his presidency he instituted about [*two-thirds* of the policy recommendations](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) from the Heritage Foundation

  
Project 2025 was developed by the Heritage Foundation, a well-funded conservative think tank. Two of the people spearheading Project 2025 worked in the Trump administration.

The Heritage Foundation has authored Mandates for Leadership since 1980.

A comment from u//graneflatsis 

>Some facts about Project 2025: The ""Mandate for Leadership"" is a set of policy proposals authored by the [Heritage Foundation](https://pro-lies.org/the-heritage-foundation), an influential ultra conservative think tank. [Project 2025](https://www.mediamatters.org/heritage-foundation/guide-project-2025-extreme-right-wing-agenda-next-republican-administration)is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President [unilateral powers](https://theweek.com/politics/heritage-foundation-2025-donald-trump), strip [civil rights](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/03/the-heritage-foundation-dei-project-2025-trump-diversity-equity-inclusion-american-fiction-erasure), [worker protections](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/08/project-2025-gut-worker-protections-labor-department-heritage-foundation-trump-2024), [climate regulation](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/04/15/a-deep-dive-into-energy-plans-for-trump-2-0-00152281), add [religion into policy](https://thecause.substack.com/p/taking-project-2025-personally-with), outlaw [""porn""](https://www.salon.com/2024/03/19/decoding-project-2025s-christian-nationalist-language/) and much more.

>The MFL has been around since 1980, [Reagan implemented 60%](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership) of its recommendations, [Trump 64%](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) - [proof](https://www.scribd.com/document/369820462/Mandate-for-Leadership-Policy-Recommendations). 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge he'll likely get past 2/3rd's adoption.

Agenda 47 is Trump’s official agenda and is basically P2025 lite. It features many of the same policies.

Trump also worked with the Heritage Foundation during his first term, and his own site references the foundation.

https://www.heritage.org/article/timeline-heritage-successes

In 2017, Trump was the keynote speaker at the Heritage Foundation’s Annual President’s Club meeting

https://www.heritage.org/impact/the-best-the-2017-presidents-club-meeting

> “The great Heritage Foundation has been at the center of several incredible tax cuts in American history, working closely with the Heritage Foundation, Ronald Regan cut taxes to unleash the economic miracle of the 1980s”
> 
> “this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize our economy, revive our industry, and renew the American dream. The Heritage Foundation can once again help make history, by helping to take this incredible idea, this proven idea, this tax cut, making it a reality for millions and millions of patriotic Americans.”

But sure, he knows nothing about their project.

# But I heard from Trump and from his campaign that he doesn't have anything to do with Project 2025 or the Heritage Foundation!

Members of the Trump political team and leaders from the Heritage Foundation have had several meetings and interactions over the years. One notable instance was President Donald Trump's keynote address at The Heritage Foundation's President's Club Meeting on October 17, 2017. During this event, Trump highlighted the administration's alignment with Heritage's policy recommendations, covering topics from tax cuts to regulatory reforms and national security​ ( [Source](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) )​​ ( [Source](https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/full-transcript-and-video-president-trumps-keynote-address-the-heritage) )​.

# Okay, so he knows who they are, but it's not like The Heritage Foundation was involved in setting the policy for his presidency, right?

Additionally, the Heritage Foundation played a significant role in shaping the Trump administration's policies. In 2018, it was reported that nearly two-thirds of the policy recommendations from Heritage's ""Mandate for Leadership"" series had been embraced by the Trump administration. These recommendations covered a wide range of issues, including withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord and increasing military spending​ ( [Source](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) )​.

# Okay, so the Heritage Foundation helped set the policy direction for his previous administration, but his team isn't involved in Project 2025, right?

The project is overseen by **Paul Dans**, who has stated that Project 2025 is systematically preparing to bring a new wave of trained conservatives into government roles aligned with Trump’s vision. The project also features contributions from over 350 leading conservatives, many of whom have previously worked in or are closely associated with Trump's administration​ ( [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025) )​​ ( [Source](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/project-2025) )​.

**Thomas Gilman**, who contributed to the NOAA chapter of Project 2025, has strong ties to the Trump administration. Additionally, David Legates, a former senior NOAA official under Trump, helped write the climate-related sections of Project 2025 and has a history of working closely with Trump-aligned initiatives​ ( [Source](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/project-2025) )​​ ( [Source](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-allies-target-noaa-climate-research/) )​.

**Troup Hemenwa**y was the former associate director of the Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) under President Trump, Hemenway has joined Project 2025 as a senior advisor and associate director of personnel placement. He has significant experience overseeing presidential appointments in key departments and has worked closely with the Trump administration and its transition team​ ( [Source](https://www.heritage.org/press/former-trump-appointee-troup-hemenway-joins-heritages-project-2025) )​.

**Stephen Miller** is a former senior advisor to Trump, Miller has been involved in Project 2025. Known for his influence on Trump's immigration policies and other key areas, Miller's involvement suggests a direct link between the project and Trump's political agenda​ ( [Source](https://theweek.com/politics/heritage-foundation-2025-donald-trump) )​.

**Mark Meadows** is another key figure from the Trump administration, Meadows served as White House Chief of Staff and is involved with Project 2025.

Biden should have shown up to the first debate with a list of names that connect that document to Trump's own staff from 2016-2020. He should have asked why Robert Wilkie, Former United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs during the Trump administration from 2018 to 2021, helped draft a plan to remove veteran access to VA healthcare and privatize tricare for active forces and their families as part of Project 2025. He should have demanded to know how Trump could pretend to be ignorant and unaware of the project when long term members of Trump's own staff helped write entire sections of it. This was never a tiny threat to our nation, the very creation of that document, complete with plans to purge the government and replace staff with Trump loyalists pulled from a database of vetted conservative volunteers, is treasonous.

- John McEntee: Former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office in the Trump administration[3]
- James Bacon: Joined Project 2025 in May 2023, previously developed a questionnaire to test potential government employees on their commitment to Trumpism[1]

• The project's advisory board includes many other officials and advisors from the Trump administration[1].

• Project 2025 is described as ""undeniably a Trump-driven operation"" by some sources, despite Trump's recent attempts to distance himself from it[2][3].

It's important to note that while these individuals are associated with both Trump and Project 2025, Trump has recently stated that he has ""nothing to do with"" the project and disagrees with some of its proposals[3][4][5].

It's not a Trump thing. It's not a Republican thing. It's a Heritage Foundation thing.

Project 2025 is merely the latest Mandate for Leadership published by the Heritage Foundation. It is published every 4 years for each president since 1980 and Reagan.

Various accomplishments they have claimed:
- Inspiring SDI / Star Wars
- Fighting and defeating Clinton's national healthcare attempt
- Inspiring the 1996 or 1997 welfare reform bill
- Defeating the immigrant amnesty bill
- Trump enacting about 2/3rds of their recommendations in the first year of his term (Reagan was about 60% too). Both Reagan and Trump have thanked them publicly in speeches.
- They provided Trump with the lists of Supreme Court candidates 

They write up policies that the GOP has followed for decades. Remember Contract with America in 1994? That was them.

Their lobbying is massive. They bragged that 70 former employees we're either part of Trump's transition team or his administration. They host orientation for new members of Congress and annual retreats for Republicans.

Trump's tweet is so laughable. Every single Republican knows who they are.

The Heritage Foundation as an organization is one of the primary think tanks in the conservative Republican power structure. Most people don't realize how substantial the network of conservative interest groups/think tanks is in this country.

See here for more information on them as a source of information:
https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Heritage_Foundation

Also check out groups like ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council) - https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=American_Legislative_Exchange_Council

Turning Point USA - https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Turning_Point_USA

These groups and many, many other smaller think tanks around the country are a coordinated network of interest groups that exist entirely to strategize about how to push conservative ideology. 

For example, how did Trump decide who to choose for the Supreme Court? He tells conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation: ""Give me a list of names of people I should nominate, and I will pick from that list."" 

From the Heritage Foundation website: ""Heritage Expert Helps Shape Supreme Court Nominee List""
https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/impact/heritage-expert-helps-shape-supreme-court-nominee-list

The way the quid pro quo works between Trump and groups whose values seem to conflict with Trump's is Trump says ""OK, so you may not like some things about me, like my known history of allegations abusing women, or my strongly stated position when i was in my 50s that I am very strongly Pro Choice. But if you help me win, I will give you what you want. I'll change my public stance on abortion, and so on, and then you support some of my views, like America first -- no more working with allies around the country, etc..."" And then both sides drop many of their values to create an alliance.

Media Matters - [A guide to Project 2025, the extreme right-wing agenda for the next Republican administration](https://www.mediamatters.org/heritage-foundation/guide-project-2025-extreme-right-wing-agenda-next-republican-administration)

“Project 2025 aims to put Christianity at the center of American government and society by turning a biblical worldview into federal law, often employing Christian nationalist talking points and narratives to support its right-wing policy proposals.”

If the Media Matters guide is a bit too text-centric for your taste, check out this straightforward explanation given in a non-inflammatory, neutral manner using a clever marker-and-whiteboard animation style. This is a good video to send to friends and family that might be interested in knowing about Project 2025 but would enjoy a lighter approach.

* [""“Joe isn’t just the right person for the job,” she told donors in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday. “He’s the only person for the job.”""](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jill-biden-fierce-advocate-biden-remaining-race-2024-07-03/)

  
There's a ton of articles saying how the family is pushing him to continue. This is from her in her most recent Vogue cover:

* [""However, the first lady told Vogue she would stand by her husband and that his campaign was “best for the country”. In comments sent to the magazine after the cover interview had been conducted, she said she “will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he’s been president”.“We will continue to fight,” she said.](https://www.vogue.com/article/first-lady-jill-biden-august-2024-cover-interview)

"> I’m completely in the same boat though. His team is scared to put him out there to remedy the problem.  If he’s not capable of being out in the public eye putting in the hours in front of voters, he’s going to get wiped. Same with the downballot races.

Same. I could have been convinced it being a one off thing if only a day or two after he scheduled town halls and called for a lengthy press conference, but he didn't because I don't think *he can*. The thing about downballot races is that they are doing *way* better than him, sometimes by six or more points.

I'm in the same boat. If I had known the state Biden was in, I would have voted for someone else and could have contacted my Rep and Senators to push for a viable primary challenge. Instead it was kept from us. I honestly wonder how much of party leadership knew it was this bad. Was it just leaders like Chuck, Jeffries, Polosi, et al? Or was it nearly the whole party that knew?

"This is 100% definitely true, though with a bit of a tweak.  The Democrats are not intentionally trying to lose, they'd prefer winning.  But because they are vessels for their corporate donors and this defines everything they do, they'd rather lose to a Republican than lose to a Progressive, since a Progressive would inconvenience the gravy train.  So Hillary didn't just want to win, she wanted to build a big enough centrist coalition so that she could completely ignore the Left after she won, which is why she spent so much time in purple states like Arizona instead of shoring up the Rust Belt firewall states.  It's the Iron Law of Institutions--people will ignore the fate of the institution overall if it means they get to maintain their own power within its walls.

There are about 7 fundamental problems with the Democratic Party, and they all stem from the fact that donors want to keep them weak so that they'll fecklessly acquiesce to Rightwing economic policy.  The more power the Democrats show, the more antsy their base gets to actually wield that power in order to help the ordinary citizen, and the corporations don't want to offer that help, it hurts their bottom line.  But another of the 7 problems is that Democrats coalesced around this strategy in the 1970's, which is why no Leftist candidate has gone anywhere since Mondale 40 years ago (and Bernie and Jesse Jackson, the only two that came close, were sabotaged intentionally).  The donors want people who have internalized this path, who as a function of their identity recognize the Democratic Party as the weak little brother of the dominant Business Party duopoly.  Which is part of why rather than promote new blood that lives in a different world post-2008 and the economic crash, and wants to foster real change to the system, all of the Democrats in charge in their 70's and 80's.

It wasn't just Lieberman.  Democrats have had a strategy forever called the Rotating Villain.  Someone is either told or agrees to step up and block the agenda on behalf of the donors.  If the Dems had had 64 Senators, there'd have been 5 Joe Liebermans.  When they have 51 Senators now, Manchin and Sinema are the 2 Joe Liebermans.  There is just enough opposition to kill everything that the donors don't want,  but with the plausible deniability that the rest of the party can say that they did want it, so therefore the Democrats need to be elected because of how close they are.  There were about 12 Democrats in 2009 that were comfortable enough being the Rotating Villain.  Mary Landrieu, Max Baucus, Byron Dorgan, Evan Bayh, Blanche Lincoln, Ben Nelson....  Lieberman just didn't care because he had already been primaried by the Dems in his state, so he relished the role and no one else had to step into it.  

Good news:  It isn't the ENTIRE Democratic Party, there are many who actually do feel frustration about this, and they do want to move into the modern political age and start passing good things.  The leadership is still strong enough to shut these things down and assure the donors that ""nothing will fundamentally change,"" but the base is at levels of anger that they simply weren't 20 years ago.  Good news:  The whole thing is the donors, and therefore the whole thing is campaign finance reform, and the amount of positive multipliers from getting that in any substantial way would have such a gigantic impact on every aspect of the party that even seemingly unrelated things would almost instantly improve.  There don't have to be 200 fixes like it seems, there only have to be a couple.

"not for biden, he wont be around so it doesnt matter to him

the fact his team of decision makers (who decided to challenge trump to a debate, completely unforced, blundering biden's chances at an already super close election with an unforced error , and apparently plan on doing it again in another upcoming debate) , saw the debate, see the backlash, see the already divided dem party fracturing before their eyes, and their play is to *stay the course* --i dont want the people making terrible decisions like this running the country either. It's really unfortunate that Trump/Putin/GOP fascist machine is poised just off stage, literally being assembled (or disassembled) in plain view, religious weirdos are dripping pre-cum to the thought of finally being able to cross the barrier of that pesky 1st Amendment of the Constitution and raise their crosses over public school children; MAGA Red Hats are ""Standing Down and Standing By"" and are organized in their militias and nationalistic men's clubs which are actually armed and have been cosplaying scenarios like this in their backyards... they are lining all their pieces up, the Supreme Court has opened the legal system's portculis and bowed prostrate, swearing their allegiance to what they forsee coming--  a supreme billionaire leader who rigs elections and has immunity in all 'official' acts, an all powerful position waiting for the wrong person to ascend to the throne and cease the ancient machine of American Democracy.

And meanwhile Biden is attempting to prove to Americans that he isn't a senile old man by going on TV and speaking much more loudly, reading off cue cards that other people wrote-- 'see, America,  I'm not a figurehead being controlled by a staff of cabinet members and Pol Sci interns, I'm actually able to formulate sentences! I'm not that same guy you saw on the debate stage mumbling incoherently for an hour, unable to put three coherent words together in a row, talking about how we have to cancel Medicaid and how once upon a time he golfed 6 or 8 handicap, or something.

This is the best the Democrats have? I dont believe it. But this is who they put at the helm of the ship, and Captain Joe says ""No way folks, I'm not turning the wheel of the ship no matter how much everyone is screaming ""ICEBERG!"" , you're not going to rattle ol' Jack , I mean John, JOE Biden.""

And of course he wont do anything unorthodox or defy tradition and decorum of the POTUS by like, using the newly vested powers to stop control of the country from being handed to fascists.

Katie Johnson’s full testimony in 2016:

https://youtu.be/gnib-OORRRo?si=euDQmieGk6ssFcGW

Money laundering for the Russia mob is the common denominator between trump and epstein

•Epstein was fired (quietly) from bear stearns for money laundering that made Bear Stearns look bad enough that they didn’t want it to bleed onto them in public

•In 1982 Epstein went from Bear Stearns to J. Epstein and Company which was founded for exclusively  $1B+ clients but no one could ever say who they were because they were Russian oligarchs who were in the process of stealing $1.4T worth of perestroika money from Russian grandmas

•Epstein learned and understood the neurosis of “poor little rich kids” because he taught them all at Dalton.  He probably knew more about the dysfunctional families of Wall Street than their therapists did.

•Vicky ward (vanity fair) dug into Epsteins  finances with her article - The Talented Mr. Epstein

•Epstein was “bounty hunting” (his words) money lost to fraud because he knew the fraud networks by then because he worked for/with them. It was easy money double billing.

•1989 Epstein becomes friends with Wexner who is effectively the head of the Zionist mob who would sign over power of attorney for his entire fortune to Epstein within 2 years.

•Epstein would threaten journalists who wrote badly about him

•Towers financial was a debt collection company cover for a Ponzi scheme

•Epstein was originally hired there as a consultant

•Hoffenberg (towers principal) says it was all Epstein doing the Ponzi scheme

•Prince Andrew’s parties were all young (bizarrely dressed) Russian models

This was a couple years before the Russian model Ruslana Korshunova’s death.  She was taken to Epsteins island at some point

https://youtu.be/NhMiRMsUgNk

She and her Ukrainian best friend Anastasia Droznova began putting the pieces together as to why the Russian oligarchs that preyed on them were so interested and invested in Ukraine. (Kolomoisky started privatbank in 91)

https://amp.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/young-russian-models-were-members-of-dehumanising-cult-prior-to-deaths-book-claims-20141119-11pnqn.html

•MC2 (pronounced MC squared) was the modeling agency that Epstein, Brunel, and the mob would use to get trafficked girls into the US with “genius visas” https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/former-model-agent-close-to-jeffrey-epstein-found-hanged-1235085929/

•Epstein would promise girls a modeling contract to have sex with people in his network including Wexner although Wexner was reportedly gay which created a need for young male models.  Abercrombie and Fitch was part of L brands which was used as Wexners quiet personal feeding grounds for “white hot male models”

https://www.netflix.com/title/81323741

https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/s/oy54vmuTNo

•Leon black, trump, Weinstein etc were all Epsteins Kompromat clients because that’s what the Russians needed for the perestroika 2.0 commercial real estate edition play they are in the middle of now.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xa3K85fStBw&feature=youtu.be

•Epstein had a stuffed black poodle on his piano and wanted people to think about what it means to stuff a dog. (His words)

Executives of Naftasib[clarification needed], a Russian energy company, funneled almost $3.4 million to Abramoff and DeLay advisor Ed Buckham between 1997 and 2005. About $60,000 was spent on a trip to Russia in 1997 for Tom DeLay, Buckham, and Abramoff. In 1998, $1 million was sent to Buckham via his organization U.S. Family Network to ""influence DeLay's vote in 1998 on legislation that helped make it possible for the International Monetary Fund to bail out the faltering Russian economy"". DeLay voted for the legislation. The money was funneled through the Dutch company Voor Huisen, the Bahamas company Chelsea Enterprises, and the London law firm James & Sarch Co.[46][47] The executives involved, who met DeLay during the 1997 trip, were Marina Nevskaya and Alexander Koulakovsky. Nevskaya was also involved in Abramoff's support of an Israeli military academy, according to an email sent to Abramoff.[48]

Haters coming at me for speaking truth.  Guess what?  Those folks are hopping aboard now.  

It happens that people have to step aside for health reasons and there’s no shame in that.

There is no doubt that any Democratic leader (most likely it’s Harris) is going to stepping into a position where they will be better prepared, physically and mentally to handle the job than Biden is right now.

It’s just surprising to me that anyone could live in this high state of denial as if Biden is even remotely capable of doing the job.

It’s very odd for sure, but then there’s plenty of oddballs in both parties so it shouldn’t be surprising I guess.

For the majority of people though, they are now starting to realize there is no other good option.

Anyone with eyes, ears, and a brain now sees the truth that Biden is unfit.

Biden needs undecided and Independent voters.  He’s not going to get them based on the obvious truth.

Yet instead of being honest, some Biden supporters feel compelled to deny the obvious truth.  The truth is he’s an old man in cognitive decline.

How the hell do people fall under the spell of blind partisanship anyway? 

It’s as if their brains get hi-jacked along with their ability to be objective. 

They lie to themselves and then they expect others to agree with a ridiculous fantasy, that it’s somehow “better” to expect a declining incoherent candidate to remain in the most important job in the world instead of bringing in someone who is capable, healthy, competent and strong.
It makes no sense.

People are funny, fickle, and very short-sighted by thinking that it’s only about winning this election without understanding that we need someone who can handle the demands of the most important job in the world for the next 4 years.

The idea that Biden could be a President in “name only” while his staff performs the job is a terrible idea.
And still we have some pinheads repeating the insane narrative: “It was only 1 bad debate.”  Nonsense!

Yet all is not lost.  Despite Biden’s proclaiming he’s in this race to win it, I believe that he will bow to the inevitable reality of his personal limitations.

It’s rare to be gifted a clear opportunity to reboot the Democratic Party. What is clear is that Biden has a chance to put the party first and get behind the best candidate to bring home the win.

He should do that and I believe he will.

Dems will rally behind any reasonable, solid candidate against Trump. Even the stubborn Biden hold-outs will vote for any good Democratic candidate whoever it is. They would be foolish not to.

I think it will almost certainly be Kamala Harris and I expect the announcement within the next 10 days.

Not to mention many jurisdictions are trying to get them the right to vote ASAP. Again, can't think of what would kill democracy faster than non citizens making choices for citizens of another country.

When your Defense Secretary tries to warn the public that you are dangerously insane, that's important.

General Mark Milley also tried to warn the public about something that is Tier 0, end-of-the-world dangerous and the subtlety of his message was lost since he tried to maintain strict military professionalism (then the media pooped the bed and focused entirely on whether or not Milley was a traitor for doing his official job) and is clearly not trying to panic the global populace.  If you read between the lines it is painfully, dangerously clear that the US started to seem so unstable, and Trump seemed so desperate to stay in power, that China had come to the logical conclusion that Trump would try [to wag-the-dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_dog).  Milley claims that conclusion was not true, but they certainly believed that (and they do have an intel agency, so I doubt it was just run-of-the-mill paranoia that we should laugh out of the room and my personal guess is that Trump said something nuts in passing that he might have even meant at the time like his comments about launching cruise missiles against Mexico, though it hardly matters either way as it almost led to a third World War)  [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-gen-milley-explains-his-calls-with-china-over-concerns-about-president-trump](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-gen-milley-explains-his-calls-with-china-over-concerns-about-president-trump)

In 2019 Dream Center owned schools fell into receivership, because as expected, they had no idea what they were doing. Stole student loans, by not giving back stipends at all for months on end (Title IV funding states it has to be sent back to the borrower in 14 business days), One school lost accreditation entirely, they not only did not inform the students, but still took loans (a violation of TitleIV funding) and students ended up getting degree's from a school that was no longer accredited or took classes that were no longer accredited.

No one knows where the federal tax payer money they received in student loans actually went to.

Biden's picks are the reason why the Department of Education has been working on forgiving student loans. Some of which were affected by the Trumps admin allowing Dream Center to buy and tank 3 entire schools across many states.

"I know (and understand why) the common wisdom on Clinton is people don't like her. She's not very inspiring to me either. That said, she's basically the most battle tested woman in American political history, having weathered unrelenting right wing propaganda and attacks since the start of the 90s and was still popular enough to barely lose to Trump and get more actual raw votes.

None of these governors are battle tested in that way, to that degree, and no matter who you pick, they're getting the full force of the right wing propaganda machine. Whitmer is disliked in the crank circles already. Your most annoying uncle likely thinks she's terrible and entrapped law-abiding American citizens with the help of the FBI (the stupid Infowars take on her), but the entirely politically unengaged undecided folks don't even know who she is. And while I think she can make a great impression (as I think she is great), she, or Newsom, or Beshear, would get the super condensed, super potent, 4 month version of the right wing propaganda treatment, the kind of propaganda that gets to the politically unengaged and undecided.

They're all gonna get the Clinton treatment should they run, and none of them are gonna come out better for it. Let's say Whitmer gets the nod and is debating Trump. For this hypothetical, think like an undecided who doesn't know shit: Trump spends the entire time he's supposed to be answering something else saying quick, snappy Trump lies. ""She worked with the FBI to entrap honest Americans who were exercising their God given rights, people who didn't do anything wrong at all, who just wanted to have the freedom to not be given an experimental medical treatment, and now those honest people are in jail."" The moderators don't ask him about it, they don't try to keep him on question, he just spews lies that require specific and detailed answers (that the undecided don't want to hear) to try to refute, the media runs with Trump's simple framing and doesn't give her answers any oxygen, etc. How does that one example (and he'll do something like that to everyone, about everything) sit with your undecided voter in a swing state?

>the pundit class of the American media is suffering from severe memory loss. Because they’re doing exactly what they did in the 2016 presidential race – providing wildly asymmetrical and inflammatory coverage of the one candidate running against Donald J Trump.

What we cover, how we cover it, determines often what Americans think is important and how they perceive these issues yet we keep pretending it’s not so.” They are not reporting that he is a loser; they are making him one.

We've been living in a bit of an illusion in America. Modern technology has created creature comforts and intellect engaging entertainment unlike any other time before. So many people had tuned out of politics and focused on entertainment and money making. Meanwhile, with such distractions going on, the devious have been making progress. All it took was someone to come along and become the standard bearer: Donald J. Trump. What better man than the bombastic, intimidating, spectacle laden billionaire who had a hit TV show?

I used to think to myself ""We're in the 21st century now. We elected a black US president. We're making progress towards a better world for everyone."" Meh. ***WRONG***.

The mindset of people in the far-right Republican Party is no different than the *Confederates of the 19th century*. They're just clad in modern clothes and use present day technology. These people want to return to a time of white supremacy. Clear, wide, stark divisions of economic classes. A majority of people living as indentured servants, while the wealthy class lives it up.

We have domestic stochastic terrorism flourishing before our eyes. Challengers to the pushers of fascism are met with an avalanche of death threats and perpetual harassment. Even witnesses are doomed. Do you know that the far-right has been tenaciously doxing anyone who Trump hates? And once that happens, the threats come. So many of them have to sell their homes and leave to live somewhere else. That's the kind of dynamic the far-right has created.

The SCOTUS must be reformed. Term limits. Age limits with exceptions that require tests and evaluations. And any justice who has been appointed that has shown to be incompetent or corrupt? FIRED. Bribery? FINED and FIRED.

"Unless the military seizes control of blue states in this scenario (which I think is highly unlikely, as the military exists to protect the Constitution not government), most red states will fall apart quickly. Most red states lost any valuable infrastructure and economy once outsourcing manufacturing became popular (which Republican policy is responsible for, ironically enough). They are 100% propped up by blue states, who are responsible for most of the country's tech, agriculture and tax money. 

Even some of the potentially stronger contenders like Texas or Florida would be fucked the minute they get hit by a hurricane or natural disaster.

"Have you noticed that conservatives talk about American Revolution, Civil War, and still support the guy who wants to be a dictator day one? This is the Republican Party. 

Voters should focus their attention on conservatives’ Project 2025.  If you think conservative justices overturning Roe was bad, the MAGA conservative floodgates are about to open if Trump is sent back to the Oval Office.  Trump will consolidate power, demolish the separation of powers, and appoint more conservative justices.  As John Oliver said in a great segment he did on project 2025, it will turn the separation of powers into Rock, Paper, Scissors, except Rock will crush Paper and Scissors every time.

It’s interesting, and should be horrifying, that Project 2025 starts off its 920 page report with the phrase, cultural Marxism, because it has a dark heritage.

     “The long march of [cultural Marxism] 
     through our institutions has come to 
     pass.”  Project 2025

Cultural Marxism is often used to describe liberals and as an analogy to political correctness.  But more often than not, it is now being used by the far right, by antisemites, as code for Jewish conspiracy.

Prior to 1933, there was a feeling in Germany that there had been a cultural and moral collapse.  This fed the populism of the Nazis.  The Nazis pushed out messaging that there was a plot to spread political, communist, and other revolution throughout the Weimar Republic and the West.  This idea, building on Mein Kampf, has been pushed forward throughout history and has now ended up in Project 2025, blaming liberals for all of conservatives’ problems.

Trump is performative arts with a dangerous authoritarian twist.  He is a carnival barker who praises dictators and incites violence.  He lied multiple times during the debate, refused to answer questions, defended January 6 rioters, and refused to say he would accept the results of the election.  Yes, Biden had a bad debate.

1. Libs are getting into hysterics about crazy hypotheticals, of course the president would never use this immunity to do crazy evil things

2. Look at how immediately the libs are talking about the president having his political enemies imprisoned or killed, the fact that they are thinking about this means that is what *they* would/will do with this power, how awful of the libs to think this way

---

The main thing that is missing in all of this is *any reasonable justification for why this ruling is GOOD, for anyone, at all.*

Like sure, maybe the SEAL team six will never happen, great! But what is the benefit aside from legally protecting Trump, personally? I guess the only benefit they can grasp is ""this ruling makes Trump more likely to be President again, therefor it is good for me"".

I think they fail to see that the examples of assassinations and such are supposed to highlight why libs DON'T want it, not what they can't wait to start doing with it!

While a federal judge is a lifetime appointment, the constitution doesn't state that they must sit on the highest court for life.  They can be rotated back to lower courts when their period is up.

There are issues to be resolved like what if the senate refuses to confirm multiple nominations to try to run out the president's term in office and what if a justice leaves early or dies.  In the latter case the law could simply state that the current president replaces that justice but the replacement only serves the rest of the 18 year term.  Not sure how to deal with the former.

It is my understanding that this can all be done via statute as congress gets to set the rules.

Look at how people are freaking out over all this Supreme Court chicanery. They knew that that would happen once they announced this shit. They also know that people freaked out over Dobbs and it backfired on them and hurt the GOP at the ballot box. 

Why would they risk these rulings, which are arguably much more egregious than even Dobbs, fucking the republicans again so close to the election (especially since they could have simply punted the immunity ruling, just for example, back down to the lower courts)? It’s because they are somehow already certain that the election is not going to matter. 

Remember the part in Watchmen when Ozymandias is all like “I did it 30 mins ago.”? That’s the stage we’re in now. They wouldn’t have risked the blowback from these clearly corrupt rulings unless they had already discovered, implemented, and *100% guaranteed* some way to render the results of the election completely moot regardless of turnout. I have no idea what their plan is, but they wouldn’t be acting this way if there was even a slight possibility it wouldn’t work.

The only way to defeat it is to do something they haven’t accounted for. Like perhaps Biden growing a spine and using these newfound powers to actually stop the coup somehow.

The Government, under Boris Johnson, offered to create an exemption in law specifically for her, which she declined. All around the country there were people in similar situations who could not attend the funerals of close family members, and she felt it wasn't right for her to carve her own exemption while those less privileged had to suffer alone.

It's a bit of boon for them, really.

They tell them this threatens their future, their masculinity. They get them riled up on conspiracy theories, misogynistic streamers, podcasts, tiktoks, and other social media platforms. They bait them into stoicism, fascism, plutocracy, using easy to digest and share memes. They carelessly share these memes and act out, getting them booted from progressive and liberal circles, possibly even doxxed and fired if they work for a company that cares to. This leads to even more isolation, and who comes back to offer them a place to be? A fascist.

Boom: these kids and young men become radicalized, they point to their lost jobs and rejected advances as ""proof"" that the fascists are right. They join the people that promise them ""obedient tradwives"" and an end to feminism.

It's really dangerous to assume that every incel is a gravyseal that can't travel a quarter mile without a mobility scooter. A lot of them are in gyms, lifting and looking for potential recruits.

I get nearly no one here understands partisan non-response and most don't understand polling other than the two final numbers, but calling the title ""generous"" based on the quoted info, is pretty misinformed. 

In the latest NYT/Siena poll, did you know Biden leads Trump among 2020 voters 49-45? Did you know that was the highest turnout election ever? Did you also know in that same poll, NYT/Siena thinks new voters will make up 19% of the electorate in 2024? Thatsvan absurd number given the historical turnout in 2020. It's not possible.

Since the debate Biden has only dropped 1.5% in the polls but Trump has only gained 0.4%. Voters aren't moving to Trump, and he's a historically weak candidate. They moved to undecided, nearly all of them will return to Biden in a few weeks or less. 

Trump has a legitimate ceiling of 47%, and it's probably worse this time because of J6, Roe ending and being a convicted felon since the last election. Roe alone is good enough to knock him down further with women and a few points overall. The felony convictions will absolutely hurt him with independents, no matter what the polls are saying now. Trump's realistic ceiling is probably closer to 45%. That's not going to win a presidential election.

Sure, it's a solid blue state and they'd be happy to make an exception to get a replacement on the ballot... until some random Conservative group files a lawsuit claiming doing so in unconstitutional. Due to the nature of the election SCOTUS prevents the change until they can make a ruling in a special session - and then the people directly responsible for constructing the arguments for Bush v Gore get to choose whether the actual candidate or the former pick are allowed to be on the ballot at all.

Clinton lacked the personal charisma of Obama, so the voters largely rejected her. Similarly, while people were willing to given Biden a chance in 2020, it's clear that a **lot** of people have soured on him, and this whole ""pick the bus heading in the right direction"" talk isn't going to sway Obama-Trump-Biden voter Dave from Arizona, who barely pays attention to politics and thinks Biden looked awful in the debate.

There's a reason that Michelle Obama, a lawyer with no prior political experience aside from being First Lady, consistently emerges as the most popular potential candidate for the Democrats. She has the charisma that Hillary and Biden lack, and charisma wins elections.

">Democrats always do this. Republicans pick their guy then line up and send one clear message. And Democrats in-fight until it’s too late. 

I agree with this part. And it's the reason for this:

>And there simply is no single candidate that achieves this. Which is why the conversation is always about “Someone Else” and never about a specific person.

Because the Democrats almost always place seniority over merit. That's why it was a huge upset by Obama in 2008 against Clinton and why the DNC did everything in their power to ensure she was the candidate in 2016. Joe was the clear senior leader of the party in 2020 and coasted through the primaries.

The Democrats could have spent the last four years grooming the next 1-3 candidates and ensuring Joe would have a strong successor. But as Harry Reid, Pelosi, Feinstein, and others have shown, the way it works is you wait in line for decades until you get your turn and then you hold on to your senior leadership position as tight as you can.

Don't forget - AOC, probably the biggest young star, was barely even allowed to participate in the 2020 convention - I think she got a video speech of a minute or less. The Democrats have no interest in putting forward the candidate with the most momentum or popularity, it's always just whoever is next in line.

Personally, I think jumping ship from Biden ASAP is the only thing that will tell voters that the Democrats care more about this country than themselves.

"**Tl;dr if you cannot give me the methodology then I’m going to take these points at face value and discard them. I’m posting my qualms piecemeal, you can read them if you want.**

The problem is there is no mention of the methods. 

Without knowing how they comducted the poll, I cannot say for certain if I am convinced of their ability to control for extraneous variables and their conclusion.

For instance, *wording* and *presentation* are important. Are these surveys done via telephone? Email? Were the questions given all at once or one at a time? How was it worded?

These things matter. Let me list just *my* reservations:

1. Despite having a question on the survey asking “how much of the debate did you watch?” Neither article mentions those averages (Ramussen presumably because paywall. The other article because it isn’t the one who conducted the survey.

**what’s the problem with (1)**

We’ve seen enough movies and games get review bombed to know that someone who hasn’t played the game, yet has an opinion of it is not someone to be taken seriously. How much did they actually watch? What is the correlation between the amount people watched and their opinion on the results of the debate?

This is something that could provide additional information on how the American populace engages with politics. They certainly tested for it, but no reason is given as to why they tested it only to leave out the results (you should usually give the results, even when they do not tell you what you’re looking for).

2. How were the questions given? One-at-a-time should be okay, but if the participants had access to all the questions at the same time, then it could shape their perception of the debate. 


**What’s the problem with (2)**

Question 3 can be a loaded question if I can see all the questions. If a participant decides to read each question *prior to* answering them, this might affect their answer. If you (a participant) are unsure who won the debate, but you have a question specifically calling out a particular candidate as having lost the debate, this might sway your opinion on the matter. It unnecessarily introduces bias into the survey with no way of correcting for it (perhaps by asking a more generalized question geared at both Biden and Trump’s performance or ability to stay in the race). In fact, after question 2, the rest of the survey centers on Biden’s performance. This appears less like a general post-debate survey and more like Rasmussen wants to answer specific questions. However, these questions are not given in a neutral and forces the participants to go down a line of reasoning they may not have considered because they never saw a problem, thus reshaping their perception of the events. **Simply put, the survey railroads them towards a particular set of conclusions, instead of just compiling their general thoughts.**

3. What’s the breakdown of participants by political affiliation? We know 1,117 people were surveyed, but the Rasmussen article does not indicate their political affiliation, while the other article you give mentions a percentage breakdown by party. Also the survey doesn’t ask for party, so when did they ask and why isn’t it shown (again, assuming paywall)

**What’s the problem with (3)**

Well of course republicans are going to want him to drop out, but what are democrats and unaffiliated voters saying? How many were participants in this study? If you say 57% of voters thought Biden lost and >50% of those surveyed said they were Republican, well then this survey doesn’t have the same weight anymore. If Democrats made up a significant portion of the those surveyed, then that’s different (but then see qualm number 2 for the issue there), but there is no way of telling without the methodology.

The votes of redditors and MAGA paint chip eaters are locked in and thus meaningless.  It’s the swing state undecideds and so-called indepedents who will decide this.  (And, now, unfortunately, Biden/Harris awful hubris may also cause defeat by repelling even their normal base of loyal supporters.)

Biden has failed with group that decides elections. He was polling in the 30’s with them before the last couple weeks of implosion.  There’s no fixing that.

That group may be superficial, but they’re transparent about what they want:  


* young
* non-Washington
* business pedigree 
* known but not too much
* great communicator
* looks the part
* has a penis
* can marshall hundreds of millions overnight
* is liked by Fox News
* is liked by people across the political spectrum
* can destroy Trump with ease and has proven it in practice
* hard to tell if they’re Democrat or Republican at first glance

There is one candidate who checks every box and has extensive experience destroying Trump’s lies with persuasive precision.  It’s a guy who constantly appears on right wing media to dissect Trump’s lies, and even they grudgingly like him, so the “independents” will too.

Those of us who see it as disrespectful. Seeing something one considers disrespectful doesn’t require that you or any other agree that it is disrespectful in order for that perception to exist; and calling  out what one considers disrespectful doesn’t make it racist or Nazism,  let alone because the perceived offender is Black. Being Black does not elevate one’s actions above criticism.

Why did Trump have difficulty calling out White Supremacy?

He’s not had a problem calling out white Supremacy, but all Republicans are fed up with the constant insistence that we must continually state our condemnation of white supremacy despite having already done it. So in that debate I would assume the first thought to come to his mind was, “Why is this dipshit asking me for the umpteenth time to condemn what I have already condemned.” Then he probably moved on to, “Who all would I be condemning since this is the Proud Boys that is being referenced? Isn’t their leader a Black man? How do I know every person in that group is a white supremacist given they are led by a Black man? Wouldn’t it be good to have those votes given votes win elections? I’ve never heard a Democrat tell anyone not to vote for them. I bet not a single Democrat would turn down the vote of anyone given votes win elections. Screw these dipshits, I don’t know if these people are actually white supremacists or not, but I know they are going to vote for someone. It might as well be for me, so Im not going to alienate that vote to satisfy these assholes” …and then he just ignored the stupid question that he had already answered before. But that is a tactic of the Left to continually demand a condemnation of what has already been condemned, in part to create the illusion that it has never been condemned. So, as soon as Biden comes out and tells white supremacists or any other racists not to vote for them, then you can make an issue of it.
