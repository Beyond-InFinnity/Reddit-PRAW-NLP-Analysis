"Two possible things that they are referencing:  
 
Perhaps drawing lines from Riga to Dubai and Taiwan to Seoul activates ancient ley lines that wake up dragons and phoenixes. Lighting these lines on fire brings these mythical creatures back to restore balance to the world, eliminating the need for Wi-Fi and gluten intolerance by 2027. Get ready for a magical new era!  
  
Or the more plausible explanation:  
  
 
It's 2025, and Donald Trump retakes office after being ""re-elected"" as President of the United States, in the same manner in which Bush was ""elected.""  
  
By mid-2026, Trump announced the abrupt withdrawal of all military and financial support for Taiwan and Ukraine, stating a new focus on domestic priorities — the United States withdraws from NATO. This decision sends shockwaves across the geopolitical landscape.  
  
Behind the scenes Trump hands U.S. intelligence data to his puppet masters; this information is disseminated to foreign geopolitical opponents of the United States — former foreign adversaries anyway.  
  
In Eastern Europe, Russia seizes the opportunity. With Ukraine no longer receiving US military aid, Russian forces overpower Ukrainian defenses before NATO can compensate, leading to the complete annexation of Ukraine by late 2026. Emboldened by this success, Russia sets its sights on the Baltic states, stirring tensions in NATO and prompting a much larger military buildup across Eastern Europe.  

Simultaneously, in East Asia, China accelerates its plans to annex Taiwan. By early 2027, without the deterrence of US support, China launches a full-scale invasion. Taiwan, despite its valiant resistance, is overwhelmed by the sheer might of the Chinese military. This invasion sends ripples through the region, destabilizing the balance of power.  

In response, South Korea, Japan, and other (former) US allies in the region hastily increase their defense budgets and military readiness, fearing they might be next. China, now emboldened by its success in Taiwan, starts asserting more aggressive claims in the South China Sea and even begins influencing smaller neighboring nations like Vietnam and the Philippines through a mix of military threats and economic pressure.  

The lines drawn from Riga to Dubai and Taiwan to Seoul metaphorically represent the ignition points of these conflicts, symbolizing the spread of instability from Europe to Asia. By 2027, the world finds itself on the brink of a global conflict, with old alliances strained and new ones forming out of necessity and survival.  

In this scenario the U.S.faces severe criticism from both domestic and international fronts for its isolationist policies, which have ""*inadvertently*"" allowed authoritarian regimes to expand unchecked. The geopolitical landscape is dramatically altered, with significant long-term consequences for global security and economic stability.  
  
Meanwhile the Republican Party is two years into  Project 2025. Civil liberties are stripped across the board for Americans from every walk of life — except the 1%.  
  
The greatest con in the short history of the United States is nearly complete. Political opponents and dissidents are ""disappeared"" much like the Mary Doe mentioned in the court document circulating the Internet once again. 

Everything done domestically in the name of ""America First,"" and ""Family Values"" is done at the expense of whichever group of citizens is targeted. All while Republicans cheer because the ""right people"" are being affected first. Unfortunately this comes at the expense of every American as the wealth gap widens, and the American middle class finally disappears.  


   

--- 

There are those who want you to believe the second scenario is more outlandish than the first, they're wrong, it is in plain sight. There is nothing covert about Republicans plans for 2025 if they assume the presidential office.  
 
#**Do everything you can to prevent the second scenario from having a chance to play out. Vote Biden 2024.** His cabinet members and other officials will be fewer criminals, grifters and foreign agents in number. Most importantly the government will continue to ""function"" as we expect it.  

 Been a wild ride America, enjoy your last Independence Day! Or maybe not, good luck.

Another example is between 2017 and 2019 there were at least seven other investigations into U.S. military personnel for sexual offenses against Japanese women in Okinawa — and none were made public. Perpetrators had not been punished under Japanese law nor had their cases appeared in the annual reports produced by the Pentagon’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office for the U.S. Congress.

Another recent example shows how messed up things is. US openly pressured and threatened Japan to protect US military personel who killed two people because of reckless driving. Later US released him when US got him from Japan by threats. There are many incidents like this and anyone who is objective can see that.

Whenever any crime is committed, the person who committed the crime is handed over to the local Japanese government. 

The only example of “special treatment” to a soldier while I was there was to a *former* soldier whose date of leaving the military had passed, who was illegally hiding on base. 

The foreign minister isn’t complaining that they keep getting away with it, they’re complaining that it keeps happening. The root cause of this is because there are no pre-requisites to be allowed to be stationed overseas. A vast majority of these cases of negligence by US Service members are by young enlisted members. 

There is essentially no process in place to “filter out” the bad apples from creating international incidents. These pieces of shit would have raped someone, killed someone, driven under the influence, etc. in the states, and they’d be punished for it to the fullest extent of the law. But due to the fact that there is no process in place to prevent them from being stationed in another country, it damages our relationship.

Edit : Also, with the way US Service members are “prosecuted” it makes it look like a slap on the wrist to outsiders. Hypothetically let’s say my unit had someone break into the home of a local Japanese citizen. They got arrested by the Japanese, went to Japanese jail for a few days, then was picked up by our First Sergeant, and not placed in military prison. That looks like a slap on the wrist right?

Gill and Harp then [raped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape) her!<, while Ledet claimed he only pretended to do so due to fear of Gill.

The offenders were tried and convicted in Japanese court by Japanese law, in accordance with the [U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%E2%80%93Japan_Status_of_Forces_Agreement). The families of the defendants initially claimed that Japanese officials had racially discriminated against the men because they were all [African American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American) and coerced confessions from them, but later retracted the claims.The incident led to further [debate over the continued presence of U.S. forces in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Japan) among [Okinawans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_people).",95,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.011, 'compound': -0.8367}",0.07,0.919,0.011,-0.8367

Quote:

""The number of Okinawan civilians raped by American soldiers was unquestionably very high. In referring to the high – but mostly unreported – number of rapes of Okinawan women by US troops, Feifer criticizes American history as largely having ignored the issue, while Hayashi suggests that ‘the victims’ silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign’.

Rape by US soldiers and marines was particularly prevalent on Motubu Peninsula in the north during April and May 1945, after local men had been mobilized or had fled to the hills before the fighting became so intense: Soon after the US Marines landed, all the women of a village on Motobu Peninsula fell into the hands of American soldiers. At the time, there were only women, children and old people in the village, as all the young men had been mobilized for the war. Soon after landing, the Marines “mopped up” the entire village, but found no signs of Japanese forces. Taking advantage of the situation, they started “hunting for women” in broad daylight and those who were hiding in the village or nearby air raid shelters were dragged out one after another.

Claims such as these are supported by an American Military report stating that between 10 December 1945 and 24 May 1946, 1754 misdemeanour cases were investigated by the US Fleet’s 9th Military Battalion, of which 30 were for rape or attempted rape of Okinawan women. Okinawan women were terrified, alone and powerless. Given the violation that they had endured, plus their fear of their own Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) soldiers, most were unwilling to report such crimes, while those who did were usually ignored.

In other words, any figures are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg, with many historians suggesting 10,000 as a useful starting point. Even girls fleeing from caves and those who had surrendered became the rape victims of US troops (including the Marines), and on more than one occasion when locals tried to intervene they were shot on the spot.

In Lacey’s collection of memoirs from US troops on Okinawa, one marine recalls how a group of comrades found a local woman, filthy and ragged, hiding in a cave. They took her to their tent, washed her private parts and held her \[for sex\] for several days. When they ‘got tired of her… they muddied her up… put her clothes back on’ and handed her over to their commanding officer, claiming that she was a nurse they had just rescued a few minutes earlier. However, the marine who provided the testimony claims he was misquoted and that the woman was a ‘comfort woman’ (or sex slave), not a nurse. He reiterated how filthy and ragged the woman was and his disgust both at her and at the behaviour of his fellow marines.

Rape is among the most common and vile of wartime behaviour, with Weber concluding that civilian rape was ‘one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war… \[yet so common that\] most Okinawans over age 65 either know or have heard of a woman who was raped’. African American soldiers (probably from a troubled social background) appear to have gained the worst reputation, including one known as Shibarian who was feared as a persistent rapist by all local women in the village near where he was based. Also, near the isolated village of Katsuyama is a cave known as Kurombo Gama, thus named because until recently it contained the remains of three African American soldiers who were ambushed and killed by locals and IJA soldiers for allegedly raping local women. There was also an incident in which four local women were raped and later drowned.""

There's tons of women serving who have brought charges and even more that were too scared and talked about it afterwards, and probably more than that who never brought it up at all. The military also has a way of attracting psychopaths, which isn't always bad. Probably good to have people with those sorts of tendencies in a combat role rather than in regular society. The military also seems to attract a lot of the MAGA crowd too(I suspect there's a fair bit of overlap in these groups). It's no secret that those folks tend to be of the belief that america is the greatest place ever, Americans are inherently better than everyone, can do no wrong, etc. Considering the US history with Japan and how a lot of these folks talk shit about various forces in WWII without having been there or often even knowing the correct history. Well it's not a big stretch for some of them to see themselves as better than the Japanese, or even imagine that they are somehow an occupying force even. Really it comes down to the attitude of dehumanizing another which almost goes hand in hand with a lot of the other stuff I've described. I suspect that is at least a bit of what's happening here. I think the easiest solution would be to not let soldiers on bases in foreign countries off their bases. If you have an institution where sexual assault is such a problem already, then they probably shouldn't be interacting with the local population ever, but since that's not really an option, I'd say court martial and firing squad maybe?

And yes, japan has an extremely sweet deal, even with these fucked up but imo isolated cases which are 100% prosecuted unlike the crimes by Russians towards Ukrainian civilians.  The agreement is incredibly beneficial to Japan. 


Why? In exchange for bases in Okinawa, a relatively small and isolated center compared to the larger populated cities in mainland Japan,  the US gives japan a one sided defense treaty (japan is not obligated to defend US, but the US is obligated to defend Japan). This is not a means to defend themselves type treaty that the US has with taiwan, no, this is a full on the US alliance to defend japan. 


 Japan is surrounded by 3 authoritarian pos ruled nuclear armed countries (China, Putin, North Korea), whose rulers with the same mindset as imperial japan(modern japan for the most part is nothing like this).


 It's an agreement with the only country in the world whose military could go toe to toe with all 3 of those countries combined.  That's a massive benefit for japan.   


One incident over disputed islands with Russia for example could cause hundreds of japanese deaths, far more devastating than all of the sexual assault incidents by US troops in Okinawa combined(again prosecuted crimes), but they simply wouldn't risk it thanks to the US alliance (it would be suicide).


E.g.  https://www.newsweek.com/russia-planned-attack-japan-2021-fsb-letters-1762133 It's worth noting that Putin was complementing an attack on Japan before the outbreak of the Ukraine war, but being the authorian bully he is, obviously picked an easier target (or so he thought) with Ukraine who didn't have an alliance with the best military in the world (directly, arms shipments are one thing, US would be obligated with actual troops on the ground to defend japan). ",7,"{'neg': 0.143, 'neu': 0.752, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': -0.9502}",0.143,0.752,0.105,-0.9502

The music video heavily features the character threatening to activate her crime prevention buzzer. You often see these strapped to childrens' randoseru (red backpacks) 🎒.

It's very obvious that Loli God Requiem is indulging in these fantasies, teasing lolicons and pedos over their lust for these childish items. A company which makes crime prevention buzzers had to post an apology after thanking the song's creators for featuring their brand in their video.

"This is good news, but it's not over yet. Essentially these fringe parties have a simple playbook: criticize the governing parties for everything using a populist message, while flirting with xenophobia and authoritarianism. It's a simple but effective strategy that engages people and captures a good portion of the population that is uneducated and has lower social standing. Over time, as they normalize their vileness they can access portions of the voters that they normally wouldn't after they start to feel disillusioned.

So, like a cancer they continue to grow. Generally speaking the antidote is to put these clowns in power for a while so everyone gets a dose of reality and realizes that radical authoritarians only change things for the worse. So the next election they lose. Case in point, the Tories. The simpler way is for sitting governments to just govern effectively to the point that people are just doing OK. But in a time of geopolitical instability, high inflation and a reckoning of overuse of global resources, that's easier said than done. Not saying that these neo-liberal asshats that's been in power for the most part haven't been actively engendering inequality across the board in favour of their rich friends. But even so, we're living in difficult times and its no small task to get things right, even if you have the ability and the intent.

So unless the French government is able to restore some faith and actually start making peoples lives better, we can only expect the next election to be more problematic. But, good news this time around. We can expect the Ukraine war to keep going for another 2-3 years probably, and any pro-Russian government in Europe or the US will affect the result of that negatively, which will have lasting and possibly huge ramifications for not only the security of Europe in the coming generation, but on geopolitical stability as well.

Although they collaborate, they're not controlled by the same people. That's why conventions are held.

If you want to influence the DNC, you can get involved locally. Become a delegate and have a say in who gets nominated. Local delegates had a range of candidates to choose from, and after months of deliberation in 2015-2016, a majority believed Hillary Clinton was the best choice.

So this state of affairs is nothing new. But it’s also not all that surprising. Back in Rogers’ time, the GOP was the party of wealthy businessmen. They wanted stability, global trade, and minimal regulation. Their goals were cohesive and mutually complementary. At that same time, Democrats were a very strange mix of open racists (yellow dog Democrats, Dixiecrats, etc.) who identified as Democrats because Lincoln was a Republican, social progressives, college professors, and labor. These constituencies were NOT cohesive, and their goals were NOT mutually complimentary. Indeed, many of their goals were in explicit tension. But the party found ways to thread the needle.
    
Jump ahead to today, and the GOP still favors minimal regulation.  Global trade waxes and wanes (Trump is certainly not a free trade fan), low taxes remain a priority. But the GOP gets cohesion from its base of relatively poorly-educated white Evangelical voters (this honestly isn’t an insult, it’s demographically an accurate picture of GOP voters as self-reported by those voters).  That group cohesion is vastly improved by the fact that its voters habitually consume the exact same media, usually to the exclusion of all other news sources. That media source (and it’s telling that you know who I mean without me even saying the name) feeds its consumers exactly what the party asks for, and keeps their viewers highly motivated to vote.  Meanwhile, on the Democrats side, things are largely just as chaotic. Democrats rely on many minority communities for votes, while also embracing equal rights for LGBT communities, even though those same minority communities are explicitly not in favor of equal rights for LGBTers. That tension can be problematic, as the campaign for Prop 8 in California demonstrated (targeted ads in minority communities led to substantial turnout by voters who were nominally Democrats but who voted for Prop 8 by wide margins). Labor voters struggle balancing their social views (which are not aligned with the party’s views) with their economic interests (which ARE aligned with the party’s views).  Things haven’t gotten better for Democrats’ cohesiveness. Add to that: young voters have basically always favored Democrats, but cannot be relied on to actually vote.  Old voters have basically always favored the GOP, and can be relied on to vote.",19,"{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.59}",0.103,0.785,0.112,0.59

If they accomplish that (and they have little reason not to, they're pro-worker and not necessarily pro-migration, plus they don't benefit from having a looming threat of excessive immigration to bolster their vote count - looking at you Tories) then Reform simply goes away.

I imagine a similar thing is happening in France with RN.

It's not exactly what pro Ukraine people want. But it's also a far cry from supporting Nazis. That's a pretty classic central foreign policy take. I mean quite frankly it was a unanimous policy this time last year by all NATO partners.

Man keep down voting all you people want. Russia is not able to take over the rest of Ukraine and Ukraine is not able to kick Russia out of the east. It just is what it is. Unless someone finds a trillion dollars under their couch or a couple million people grind themselves into the earth in the trenches. That is the reality.

One political benefit that Putin sees in committing atrocities against Ukrainian civilians is that it repudiates the authority of the 'International rules-based order' as it's often referred to. The whole international legal framework itself. Putin believes that the international order is a sham constructed by the US to give itself a permanent position of authority over the world, and that great powers¹ make their own rules. Small countries near great powers are just pawns to use and destroy as they see fit.

Of course, even from that perspective striking a children's cancer hospital is fucking stupid as fuck. It's a terrible move politically. Striking power facilities generates a lot less international anger and does a lot more damage to the nation.

My best guess would be that Putin is hands-off when it comes to targeting for their strikes and this was never run past him. Plenty of actual Russian soldiers have completely dehumanized Ukrainians, or are just straight up psychopaths in the first place. They've been set loose to do as they will, and this is the outcome. Their goal is to cause as much suffering as possible.

The more complicated answer is because massive stores of Lithium and oil+natural gas were found in Ukraine, supplies that would’ve allowed Ukraine to essentially replace Russia as the main gas exporter to Europe and secure that rather large chunk of Lithium, which would’ve brought Ukraine closer to Europe/The West. To add, adding Ukraines population to Russias would’ve helped delay the terminal population decline happening in Russia. Russia is slowly but surely running out of Productive workers between the ages of 19-49, and this has been happening far before the 2022 Invasion of Ukraine. 

Russia can’t have that. They needed the 3 day SMO to actually have been 3 days rather than however many years it’s been now. The original plan was that Ukraine would capitulate before the west could organize and begin applying sanctions. The Kremlin figured the war would be over so quickly that everyone would kind of just move on and continue as things were.. lol. Now Russia is stuck in this war, a very costly war that isn’t helping with their population decline and brain drain, and their fear of being replaced by someone else’s gas station happened anyways, just not with Ukraine taking over.

We set up mutual aid camps, people did their best to get medical care to those who needed it, secure food and blankets, and even set up entertainment for terrified children. 

The powers that be thought we would become selfish, panicked, violent, but the reality is that disaster tends to push humanity to become altruistic, focused, and organized. To be honest, the resiliency of the human spirit on display when times get tough brings a legitimate tear to my eye.

you're aware of the wider war, I'm aware of the wider war, so why do you think the outrage and accusation of terror is specifically about only this attack and not the cumulative behaviour of Russia? the act of terrorising, by it's very nature, requires demonstration of a pattern of behaviour rather than a single incident. 

look, honestly I think you're arguing in bad faith. you know full well that Russia and the US are not equivalent. you know full well that systematically targeting 1.5k healthcare institutes in 2 years is not the same as targeting one in 7 years. you're only pushing this narrative because you don't like the US, and maybe do like aggressive dictatorships engaging in colonialism like Russia. so I'm out.",7,"{'neg': 0.219, 'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.9876}",0.219,0.709,0.072,-0.9876

A section of the game world is ruled by iron fist Vampires who have enslaved a whole bunch of humans on their land and they take “blood tithes” where they drain some blood from each person, but not enough to kill them so they have a continuous supply of blood. There is a thing called the theatre of blood that of a person were to survive, they are set free. Thing is, the theatre is a complete death trap. No citizen of the this area would ever be able to survive it’s genuinely impossible. The vampires created a story around the theatre that in the past one brave champion had in fact competed the theatre, and escaped their bondage. That story was a lie made up by the vampires. No one had ever survived. The woman who was supposed to have done it was actually turned into a horrible abomination and she now is the very first boss you face in theatre, the people hero, killing all who enter immediately. But the story prevails, no one who enters is able to tell anyone outside how impossible the task is, and so the taste of hope remains, and every day more people throw themselves at this hope with no chance of ever winning. 

The whole thing is an allegory for the rich. They convince regular folks that they could make it to the top. If you just tried a little harder, worked a little more, have as little fun as possible, you too one day could be super rich. 

Becoming super rich in the real world is technically achievable, but that’s why the Taste of Hope is so effective. All of the poorest conservatives genuinely believe if they make their boss super rich it will somehow make them super rich. They feel like those bosses and landlords “earned” that money. They “deserve it. And they think that stuff not because they actually believe it, but because if they were ever to finally break through and become rich, they would want to horde all that wealth for themselves just like the people who currently have money. They don’t want rich people to have consequences, because they genuinely believe one day that might be rich, and they wouldn’t want to have to deal with all those pesky rules and consequences if they were in the rich shoes.

The republicans have no need to do that when their judges have a majority in court, so your argument is moot there.


Besides, the court is openly corrupt. You have judges taking gifts, then refusing to recuse when the donor subsequently has a trial before the court. You have judges openly admitting to making rulings based on ideological grounds.  You have judges pulling shit out their ass and basing rulings on some obsolete 1700s belief that has absolutely no relevancy in a modern ruling. (Mostly Alito and Thomas). You also had one where the then president blocked an investigation into sexual assault claims so they could get on the court.


The problem is that the standard way of dealing with corrupt judges is impeachment, but we already know that's not going to happen. The only other alternative is to stack the court and undermine the corruption that way.

These people in the past have mostly been ignored. Knowing that they will likely vote Republican either way, most Republicans just ignore them and count on their vote. Then Trump comes in and directly courts them, stoking their fears and giving them political relevance. Something no one has ever really done before. No Presidential candidate in recent memory has ever pandered to all the fringe nut job groups out there. You have to realize that the US has a lot of white males that work blue collar jobs and are “racist”. Trump galvanized all these people and conned them into thinking he cares about them. That he will help them.

Then you have all the rich people that just see Trump as purely good for the bottom line. Lower taxes, less IRS, simply good for the bank account. They know he’s awful for the country, for the environment, everything else, but they don’t care because greed wins every time and Trump is better for their bank account.

Next you have all the people that have agendas that they know they can push through if Trump wins. Trumps middle name is quid pro quo. So everyone that has been looking for a President to buy over the last several decades has found by far their best opportunity. Trump is too busy watching TV all day to deal with pesky policy decisions, so the people that have managed to complement him the most, and therefore get cushy govt positions in his administration, are able to push through whatever they’re getting paid to push through.  

2 out of 3 of these groups likely don’t even like Trump. They just no he’s a stooge that will let them do what they want.

"> Are these ""tankies"" as big of an issue in France as fascists?

No.

No.

Obviously.

Americans are just obsessed with the subject because they want to create a false balance and they're uncomfortable with the fact that fascism has become ubiquitous. And that they, as a society, have been the primary driver of its recent success. That, and post-truth politics.

Edit: also, I forgot to mention, there is a tactic that goes a little something like this: the American far-right is extremely conspiratorial. So when they first coalesce around a fascist like Trump, organize armed, masked militias who jump out of U-hauls to terrorize city centers, then subsequently attempt a coup d'état, they will always blame their own attacks on a ""false flag"" by the far-left afterward. They can have it both ways. They can intimidate and attack and simultaneously create a fictional narrative about a spooky, non-existent ""opposing army"" of Leninists.

The most bizarre manifestation of this has been street fights between the Proud Boys and the Patriot Front, because eventually, because these cretins are irredeemable dumbasses, they start believing their own schizo narrative.

"The corruption is right there, of course it's been there. 

The problem is that our judiciary systems (worldwide) are too slow to respond. She might get indicted and even convicted, but then there will be years (more?) of appeals, motions, etc. Meanwhile, for her and the National Rally, it's just business/grift as usual.

With the current judicial systems (in France and also worldwide and now USoA) it is unlikely that her or the National Rally will actually see any prosecution soon. This delay is an important issue, a major factor that the Putin/Russians and others are now taking advantage of. With good results! Even this 'loss' is a good result. 

Authoritarian Regimes like Russia and China have a big advantage; they can act very quickly and amorally. Without judicial/court delays, they can move rapidly to avoid both local and international prosecution (hey, they just bombed a children's hospital, and there is little or no response). They take advantage of the 'moral' nation's overlong judicial reviews and long response time, to do whatever they want, in the often years-long meantime. This is ***exactly the kind of tactics*** that the Trump team is/has been doing in the US, now for years (decades?).

It's a good play, they will win for themselves in the short term. Russia and China (and now Modi/india?). But it's only a short term benefit for you as autocrats and oligarchs. Your problem, is that you will die relatively soon, and then your whole cult-ish right wing 'government' will collapse, as has been shown time-and-time-again, in history.

The elitist liberal is a character that was created and exaggerated massively by Republican media going back more than 40 years. 

We have Democrats campaign to rural poor Americans every election and they walk up and are completely nice and respectful to people. But the reaction they get is one of absolute hatred because people are trained to expect the caricature by propaganda.  It's extremely hard to get people to do on-the-ground campaigning in rural areas because of how many threats we get when we do it.

Huge amounts of effort get spent trying to open a dialogue with these people and really talk to them and they keep telling us to get the fuck off their property or else.  It's also never fun that we have to have conversations about what people we send to areas like this for campaign work because if we send somebody who's not a white dude the odds of negative reaction go through the roof.  

There's another problem in that some of these communities have political desires that are effectively impossible to achieve, like rural coal mining communities.  What they want a politician to tell them is that there's going to be a resurgence in coal.  That they'll be able to keep doing what they've been doing forever with literally no changes, and that's not happening in this reality.  So when a candidate comes to them and talks about new job training and preparing them for a post coal future, which is exactly what they need, they react angrily and reject it.  When a candidate comes to them and lies continuously about how they will bring about that resurgence in coal, they accept it.  It's what they want to believe so they believe it. 

I've tried this for years, so if you have a better idea on how to approach these people, let me know because years of approaching them like peers has only gotten me threatened.

Edit:  also, if you know how to get around the whole problem of a lot of rural churches essentially telling people that non-republicans are agents of the devil then that would be great too, because we run into that.  It's really hard to talk to people when they think they will go to hell if they agree with you on anything.

I mean your point is ignorant and dangerous, and not every progressive movement is good or healthy. Do me a favor and look into the post WWII progressives who went so far anti Nazi, they created state sponsored pedophilia, where abandoned and orphaned children were placed with caregivers the authorities knew full well were diddling them. Read some of the accounts of adults who knew full well they didn’t like diddling children, but did so because it was a leftist and progressive action and anti-Nazi, because sexual freedom is anti Nazi. The same argument you are leaning into is exactly what those people believed.

Or how about right now, what should be considered the age of the information will go down as the age of plastic for all of this Indestructible waste that we are littering our biosphere with? I bet using plastic for everything was really progressive in the 1960s. Hell until the early 1990s in school we were encouraged to use plastic in our “progressive” recycling education programs, because it could be reused and was less resource intensive than other cleaner greener materials. 

The entire point of my argument is that the 2 sides are supposed to serve equal and opposite functions in a healthy society. Progressives push for change and to move society forward while conservatives are more wait and see and steer the course. As an analogy, progressives are the sail to a sail boat while conservatives are the rudder. Both are as important as the other and serve a function that can’t be complete without each other. 


Being “progressive” isn’t inherently a good thing on its own if you don’t have an actual platform you are rallying for, it ends up spinelessly sending children to pedophiles and littering plastic everywhere for progress for the sake of progress, which is not an inherently good thing. 

Btw I am also a progressive, but your whole “shun them under a rock” and response reading like your class just finished reading the communist manifesto is wholly inaccurate and dangerous.

I'm not making a racist argument, I'm simply stating the largest segment of Israelis (ethnically / demographically speaking) are descended from Europeans (more than 1/3rd), with most of those coming from the former USSR (as a means of escaping Soviet oppression) or Eastern Europe.

Please don't make this a racism thing, it's not. People can criticize Israel without being racist or antisemitic. Forgive me if you aren't making that assertion but I do feel as if you're implying it....

"A noncombatant is not neutral. NATO is definitely not neutral towards the Ukraine war. It is a noncombatant. True neutrals enjoy more protection from international law of war than noncombatants. The two are clearly distinguished.

A neutral does not pick sides or enter into any form of alliance. Being part of NATO is not being a neutral by definition because you already take sides even before there is war.

Neutrality as a concept was developed in the 18th century. It is a policy of deterrence, either towards a specific conflict or in general, and presumes being ready to fight. It mean that if any combatant tries to involve the neutral country, it will automatically join the other side. And that only means something if you have a decent army. So declaring neutral and doing nothing to prepare for war is empty diplomacy.

Switzerland strictly adheres to it, and successfully avoided big wars. It did fully mobilize its army during the world wars as required by the doctrine. Finland was a neutral since WWII, but recently picked the side of NATO. 

The Netherlands was neutral up to WWII, and successfully stayed out of WWI but automatically became an Ally in WWII when the Nazis crossed its borders. In both world wars its army was fully mobilized, and it issued threats to both sides when pressured. It also prepared plans to invade Belgium on the German side in response to recurring British pressure over trade with Germany and using the Scheldt river to access Antwerp. 

Sweden is an example of a country that was neutral for a time, but switched its status to that of noncombatant just before WWII because it was not willing to take on the burdens of being a neutral. It still managed to stay out of WWII.",7,"{'neg': 0.118, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9528}",0.118,0.82,0.062,-0.9528

If the USSR killed exactly the amount of Germans that Germany killed in the USSR, that would have involved shooting every fourth German - even though they would have merely been even and it wouldn't have reflected who won the war. Needless to say, they didn't do that - not anywhere even close to that.

I'm talking about things like [the firebombing of Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo) - which burned hundreds of thousands of civilians to death. As could be reasonably expected by dropping incendiary bombs on a wooden city - even Robert MacNamara acknowledged it. There is a concept of proportionality in war and this far exceeded what the Japanese did to the USA. Furthermore the US sat back for 10 years while Japan was butchering China, then backed the loser of their civil war. China helped the USA win the war against Japan more than the reverse - it was not for China's benefit the USA fought, nor did China get any spoils at the end.

The original US plan [was to dismantle Germany entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan) and convert it into agrarian states. This would have killed tens of millions of Germans by starvation. At a minimum this would have happened if Germany had killed millions of allied PoWs.

This problem of mass inflows of illegal migrants is all across the West. Russia is in part helping facilitate this (e.g. into Poland, Norway, Finland). Russia's objective is to undermine social cohesion, dilute national identity and ultimately cause political instability such as in France. It's a serious issue.

P.S. in comparison to the cost of the failed Rwanda scheme, UK spends around £8 million per day on housing illegal migrants in hotels, or £3 billion a year. In comparison the Arts Council England grant per year is around £500 million. The Royal Opera House has an annual grant of £22.3 million (or less than 3 days of paying for the hotels).

As an example, Haiti. Lots of people want to blame French colonialism for Haiti’s current problems. But Haiti gained independence in 1804.

The other previous colony on the island, Dominican Republic, did just fine. 

So when does the excuse end and when does it become the people’s agency vice colonialism that is to blame?

I am not saying however that certain factors from colonialism, such as dysfunctional borders, don’t make things a lot more difficult.

They simply don’t because their governments are greedy AF and their people largely don’t care.

"My apologies but if that's the only reason for this argument that you can see, then perhaps you have to look better.

Old age dependancy is a very easy metrics to understand. As it stands now it's around 33 for UK, which means for each 67 persons of the working age (20-65) you have 33 persons of the pension age (66 and older). Which, simply speaking, means, that currently 2 working persons need to supply one pensioner. 

When we say that, we mean that at least the following things need to be paid out of their work product (there's nobody else to work!):

- pension
- healthcare
- social care
- housing (if needed)


With current demographics old age dependancy ratio will continue shifting in UK, reaching 50 around 2070, when every working person would need to provide the above for one pensioner from their work product.

This is, of course, unsustainable. It's unsustainable even now. And there aren't many options to rectify the situation.


1) Stop paying pensioners.

2) Drastically increase productivity to a level when supporting the army of pensioners isn't a problem

3) Immigration to have more workers


(1) is always possible, but perhaps it isn't what British people mean when they say they want to stop immigration. (2) was tried in Japan, tried really hard. They did a lot, they increased productivity, and they involved a lot of elders in productive work. It wasn't enough, they started immigration programs recently, otherwise economy will collapse.

And there you have it, (3) - immigration. Love it, hate it, it's all about the numbers. Now, how to do it is an open question, and I'm sure it could be solved better if society was ready to approach the discussion constructively. Unfortunately, for more than a decade topic was turned into political poison so I expect nothing good. Likely, it will lead to some right wing chancer getting to power and axing all human rights under the guise of fighting immigration, and then importing even more people, but now without law limitations keeping them as slaves.

Precedence, unfortunately, AFAIK.

If nations start to just seize other nations assets and do whatever they want with it, it basically opens Pandora's Box on that issue. No nation can be certain to invest into another, cause the receiving end might just decide it doesnt like you anymore and take all their assets for themselves, fuck you. That would lead to less investment and trust globally, which would further hurt the economy and international relations, and that isnt great for a number of reasons.

"> A major failure of solar is that the it's cheap for current rollout and it gets exponentially more expensive as you get closer to full renewables.

I've found that this is a really difficult thing to try and explain to people. The price per kwh of renewables will become a parabola. They become more expensive at the tail end from the over-capacity you need to build, but have idle and unused, to have reserves for 3, 4, 5 sigma events. As the grid approaches 100% renewables, their efficacy becomes asymptotic. They are amazing at doing the first 50% of decarbonization, but it just keeps gets harder and harder the more they make up. 

So this is where introducing other types of energy generation into a broad portfolio comes into play. Wind for when it's not sunny, sun for when it's not windy, hydro for when it's neither, and nuclear for when it doesn't rain. The goal here is to use a portfolio of different sources of energy so that you aren't susceptible to the risks of any one type. This means you need less idle infrastructure to absorb those 3, 4, 5 sigma events.

Nuclear is like the old Greek saying ""

A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in"" Nuclear is a bit more expensive upfront but long term its cheaper, requires less grid upgrades, pollutes less, only energy source that has to manage its waste, uses less resources and far less land but its our kids that will see those benifits the most. The cost to operate the nuclear reactors in Ontario before they went into refit was $30ish USD/MWh and it can manage a grid on its own unlike renewables, they will never be as cheap or as reliable as nuclear.



If you read Lazard's 2024 LCOE report and this next point is super important, actually understand it then you would see that you are wrong by atleast 17x


Lazard has the cost of firming with renewables included for the first time this year. You will see that it is already getting very close to the cost of Vogtle but they only include 4hrs of storage when they will probably need 4-6x that amount. Then Vogtle was a first of a kind and about as bad as a build can get, unit #4 was  30% cheaper than unit #3. The next build will be even cheaper.


Then the costs are only amortized for 25-30 years. In year 30 you are going to have to essentially replace your entire renewable fleet when Vogtle for instance will last at least 60 but probably 100+ years.

"Building new nuclear plants like Vogtle, costing around $15.9 billion (!!!!!!!!) per 1 GW with a long and delayed construction timeline, makes less financial sense compared to rapidly deployable renewable energy solutions. Solar, when paired with battery systems like Tesla's Megapack, makes far more sense economically, environmentally, and from the standpoint of national security. For example, a 5 GW (!!!) solar setup with 12-16 GWh of Megapack storage would cost around $10 billion—significantly cheaper than nuclear, for sooo much storage. This renewable setup can be deployed much faster, has lower maintenance costs, and provides flexibility that nuclear can't match. Given these advantages, investing in solar+wind+battery systems over nuclear is not only more cost-effective but also aligns better with urgent climate action needs.
