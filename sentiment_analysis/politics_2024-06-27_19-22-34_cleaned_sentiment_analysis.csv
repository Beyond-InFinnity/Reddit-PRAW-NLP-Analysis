">In a Wednesday notice filled with examples of vile threats against judges and prosecutors from supporters of Donald Trump, the special counsel said there’s plenty of support for a Mar-a-Lago case gag order that would bar the former president from making statements that “pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to the law enforcement professionals.”

[""Everyone wants summa me, and I've got the creepy fan letters to prove it!""](https://i.imgur.com/ipbk32s.jpeg) - Jack Smith

>Jack Smith and his team of prosecutors have been trying to convince U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that Trump should not be “permitted to lie about FBI agents intending to murder him and his family” in extrajudicial and largely online statements about the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.

>Trump’s Truth Social post about “deadly (lethal) force”

What's worse than quoting Tweets in the news? Quoting Truth Social. It's the Newsmax or OAN to Fox as Twitter. 

>Those types of falsehoods posted on Truth Social have inspired the defendant’s closely listening supporters to lash out in the past against the FBI, against judges and prosecutors in his New York criminal hush-money and civil fraud cases, the judge in his Jan. 6 case, and against Fulton County DA Fani Willis, the notice said.

Instant death is a nice reprieve from the usual torture MAGA promises to their enemies, I kinda like that last guy. 

>Vile voicemails left for Trump’s civil fraud trial judge Arthur Engoron

The transcript misspelled the F-slur, or did the Lettter E person somehow mispronounce it? Or is this a South Park situation and you can only say it unbleeped if you're gay?

>More voicemails left for Engoron

No I think it's a transcription problem, the Letter F person says ""his raeli women"",

>Not only has Trump fundraised off of his Truth Social distortions about the FBI, he’s also well aware of the “Link Between His Statements and His Followers’ Responses” and the fact that gag orders have been issued and upheld in his other cases, Smith’s notice said.

>By way of example, the special counsel said it was no coincidence that days after Aug. 8, 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, Ricky Shiffer launched an attack on Cincinnati FBI office and was shot in a standoff with law enforcement.

If that name doesn't ring a bell, he was the guy with the nail gun, died in a shootout with the cops. He brought a real rifle too, the nail gun was because he thought (wrongly) it could go through bullet-proof glass. 

>The attack unfolded after Shiffer repeatedly posted on Truth Social, saying things like “We see the courts are unfair and unconstitutional, all that is left is force” and “patriots are heading to Palm Beach (where Mar A Lago is). I recommend going and being Florida, I think the feds won’t break it up. IF they do, kill them,” attached exhibits said.

>Ricky Shiffer’s Truth Social posts

You know Chairman Mao said ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."", sounds like MAGA is taking it to heart. Alternatively, that's the most American thing a Communist ever said. 

>There have been numerous other threats like these, and Trump is on record agreeing that his supporters listen to him like no one else, other exhibits showed.

>While Trump’s defense has maintained that Smith’s bid to modify Trump’s bond conditions is an “unconstitutional” and “shocking display of overreach,” the Special Counsel’s Office has repeatedly urged Cannon to act before someone in law enforcement gets killed.

>“And just last week, a supporter of Trump called an FBI agent associated with the Hunter Biden case and claimed that, if Trump wins reelection, FBI agents will be thrown in jail; and if he does not win, the agents will be ‘hunt[ed] down’ and ‘slaughter[ed]’ in their own homes, after which ‘[w]e’re going to slaughter your whole f—ing family,'” a June 21 filing from Smith said. “No court would tolerate another defendant deliberately creating such immediate risks to the safety of law enforcement, and this Court should not wait for a tragic event before taking action in this case.”

Judge Cannon might shoot it down, we're all expecting her to. But if she does gag Trump, she will likely leave herself unshielded by the order (like Judge Merchan did), which means Trump will have a chance to go after her. He probably won't, but if he does he can come with a new nickname for Aileen Cannon (I like Plasma Cannon cause her first name is like Alien).

“I have always been concerned about preserving Roe v. Wade” Collins said Monday, adding that Kavanaugh had given her assurances during his confirmation process that the landmark opinion was safe.

“He said under oath many times, as well as to me personally many times, that he considers Roe to be ‘precedent upon precedent’ because it had been reaffirmed in the Casey v Planned Parenthood case,” Collins added, dismissing any criticism of her as partisan politics.

Does anyone in their right mind really believe Roe v Wade will be overturned? I'm pretty far right and even l acknowledge there is no way in hell it would be overturned.

This judge will get confirmed. Just deal with it. Quit being such a drama queen. Even if RvE got overturned (won’t happen), then it just goes back to the states. Just get a $95 round trip plane ticket to the nearest state where it’s legal. Quit being such a snowflake.

Trumps team has already set it up so if he does poorly, it was either because Biden was on performance enhancing drugs, or the moderators were libs, or or or. He deals in grievance identity politics, so others who can’t accept their own responsibility in their own lives are drawn to him.

Plus the MAGA movement is a cult. Backed by other not great groups (heritage foundation, etc) whose vision for the US echoes that of Nazi germany. Heck, Jerry Swalwell helped get evangelicals on board with Trump and no one seems to want to talk about the fact he was scummy and a criminal.

"The odd thing is, they are right. The problem is, what they think they are right *about* is wrong.

  The job of the Supreme Court is twofold: to determine if a case meets the standards set forth in a law, or whether the law itself is in compliance with the constitution and judicial precedence. The court is not concerned with what they or anyone else thinks is right or wrong.

  People tend to disregard this completely and focus instead on a decision as viewed from *their* perspective and not from a purely legal one. This then leads to the belief that the court reached a decision based on ideology(and wasn't impartial), meaning they think the judges rule based on feelings rather than the law. It just doesn't work that way.

  That said, what is evident is each decision made by the Supreme Court is heavily influenced by ideology. Just not in the way people think. Conservative judges lean toward strict interpretation of the law and the Constitution (it is what it says, nothing more, nothing less.); whereas a liberal judge holds a firm belief in what the same implies. ( it doesn't say it, but we know what they meant).

 One approach leads to rulings too rigid and doesn't allow for any improvement, the other has no bounds to what may be construed, given enough creativity.

 This is the essence of what we're seeing in the court; and perhaps it is inevitable and will continue as it has since the beginning. One solution would be to mandate that the court be comprised of an even number of each. They can continue to be stubborn and come to a tie every time, or it may motivate them to stray from their ideology enough to work together and reach a majority ruling, even if it meant sending a law back to congress for a rewrite.",-10,"{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.5585}",0.063,0.869,0.068,0.5585

>A few days ago, I was talking with a young conservative who admitted that Trump was an “odious thug”, in his words, but argued that the US and the world had become such a mess that we need an odious thug as president.  
  
“Think of Putin, Xi, Kim, Ali Khamenei, Netanyahu – they’re all odious thugs,” he said. “We need our own odious thug to stand up to them.”  
  
I demurred, saying that direct confrontation could lead to more bloodshed, even nuclear war.  
  
He continued: “We need an odious thug to shake up Washington, stir up all the ossified bureaucracies now destroying America, do all the things no one has had the balls to do.”  
  
When I looked skeptical, he charged: “We need someone to take control!”  
  
As soon as he uttered those last words, he and I both knew the conversation was over. He had spilled the beans. He was impatient with the messiness and slowness of democracy. He wanted a dictator.  
  
I’m not sure how many Americans attracted to Trump feel this way. It’s consistent with the strength-versus-weakness framework Trump is deploying.

Anderson was a relatively unknown politician, at least nationally, and had split from the Republicans after Reagan became the front runner. He said:

Most policies being pushed by those two are supported by Dems, just not as far to left. Ergo why I said they're blander versions of Europe's left. But let's stop pretending that Dems don't support any form of progressive policy.

And if you've actually been travelling these days, you'd see that many of Europe's left are starting to shift more to the center out of political necessity. Saying it doesn't have to be like that when much of Europe is shifting to the right is just laughable.

But let's also talk about the right too. I'm not sure many countries have laws, which have been implemented or are being pushed, as extreme or theocratic as the ones being pushed by Republicans.

If slavery is ""being forced to work to survive"", one could argue that almost everyone is a slave. 

Sure you aren't under threat of direct physical violence, but not working means you're homeless and unable to obtain food. If you cannot find another source of income, you're forced to perform labor to protect your life.

But if we require the threat of physical violence,  what if the plantation owner won't pursue an escapee?  You can leave any time, but again you have no way to support yourself -- no food, no job, no home.  Are you still a slave if you can technically leave?

If you state ""slavery is objectively evil, 100% of the time"", it can still be argued that modern day employment can be considered a form of slavery. You **have** to work to survive.

Biden weaponized the DOJ. Trump talked about locking Hilary up, but didn’t. Meanwhile liberals have accused Trump of every form of high treason, but that’s not what they charged him with. No, they charged him with ticky tacky crimes that the justice department normally wouldn’t bother going after. 

Biden has poured money into Ukraine at a time when we can’t afford it. Ukraine isn’t a close ally, isn’t a part of NATO, and is horribly corrupt. That money could be used domestically. Our debt has reached dangerous levels as bigger and bigger portions of our funds must be allocated to paying off the interest. Trump didn’t get us into any new wars and Putin may not have attacked if Trump were president. 

Similarly massive money printing has devalued our dollar and made basic necessities prohibitively expensive. This makes us more susceptible to manipulation by foreign powers. 

Illegal immigration has become a massive problem under Biden’s policies. They’ve begun draining considerable resources from cities across the country. Biden wants to change the demographics of the country in the hope that it will benefit his party at the expensive of US citizens. 

Biden’s policies have promoted social strife within schools as they push liberal agendas on kids. Promoting trans as a way of getting attention and sympathy, teaching critical race theory, and normalizing abortion.

"You can't let in up to 15 million illegal immigrants into this country, while at the same time, up to 1/3rd of Americans, working class, are suffering from inflation and the basic cost of living. You can't take tax dollars, the blood and sweat of working class American citizens, then give it in terms of hotel rooms, gift cards, specialized food, goodie bags and everything else to illegals and then expect those American citizens to come out and vote for you. 

Now you have some of those illegals who are committing crimes, including rape and murder. You can't have a 12 year old being raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant, based on the current administrations policies, then expect moderates, independents and undecided voters to come out and vote for you. I recognize many illegal immigrants just want a better life for themselves. And for their families if they have them. It's not all of them doing this, but breaking big cities financially over illegal immigrants plus funding two more ""forever wars"" while Americans are struggling with prices at the grocery store, that's not going to win you any elections. 

Saying ""Trump Bad"" a thousand times in a row doesn't make gasoline prices, rent prices and grocery prices go down. Then Karine Jean Pierre is sent out, again and again, to say nothing is wrong. And mostly silence from our Commander In Chief, who can barely walk up a flight of stairs. He thinks his uncle was eaten by cannibals.

Is Donald Trump better than Biden on ""democracy""? I don't know. Most people don't care. What most people will care about is if Trump is better than Biden on what it costs to survive as a working class American citizen. 

Here's the secret sauce - Lots of Republicans hate Donald Trump too. But they like his policies. His policies look way more like common sense compared to the past three and a half years of this Biden disaster zone. And it's not the ""messaging""  There is no messaging that can justify allowing up to 15 million illegal immigrants into this country, where they are swarming big cities that can't afford to take care of them, while working class Americans are hurting. All the ""messaging"" does, when The View, CNN and MSNBC say nothing is wrong - it just insults those moderates, independents and undecided voters you need. It's insulting because it's telling those people they are too stupid to see what is going on right in front of them in their day to day lived reality. 

Blaming Donald Trump is not going to be enough. You need to help working class America. In a meaningful way. The Biden Administration only acted on the border crisis when the polling numbers got too bad for them. It looks like tyranny against working class Americans. 

I want nothing to do with more Donald Trump. I think he's an idiot. But if the DNC wanted to actually beat him, they could have picked a Josh Shapiro or an Andy Beshear instead. You can't push out a faltering geriatric like Biden, where everything he touches turns to a disaster, and expect to beat anyone else.

"The man is literally responsible for current economic woes. That's the part that's most frustrating about all this.

Inflation doesn't happen instantly. It's a snowballing effect that builds over time. Trump shortsightedly implemented *massive* tax cuts and engaged in high levels of deficit spending. Then, after Covid hit, he tried to spend his way out of it.

When the government runs a deficit, it has to borrow money. It borrows the money from the Federal Reserve, which controls the flow of money into the economy via interest rates. Trump put high pressure on the head of the Reserve to keep interest rates as low as possible.

The problem with that is that when interest rates stay low, especially artificially so, inflation goes up. Tons of money gets pumped into the economy, money that has to chase the same amount of goods that existed before the money was pumped in. Prices skyrocket and the increases don't fix themselves, unmanaged they just get worse.

Biden managed to rein in the inflation Trump caused, at least for the most part. Trump, for his part, is pushing for policies that will absolutely kick inflation to levels never before seen in this country.
