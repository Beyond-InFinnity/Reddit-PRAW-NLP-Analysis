"Ukraine war briefing: 

>A day of mourning has been declared in Kyiv by mayor Vitali Klitschko after a daylight Russian missile barrage hit Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital and killed dozens around the country. All flags will be flown at half mast on municipal buildings throughout the city, he said in a Telegram post, and entertainment events will be cancelled. The strike was among the heaviest attacks on the capital since Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Twenty-two people were killed in the capital, including two staff members at the hospital, where three children were hurt. At least 36 people were killed across Ukraine. The Ukrainian president posted on the Telegram messaging app: “Russia cannot help but know where its missiles are flying, and must fully answer for all its crimes: against people, against children, against humanity in general.”

>After the strikes, US president Joe Biden promised “new measures” to boost Ukraine’s air defences. “Russia’s missile strikes that today killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians and caused damage and casualties at Kyiv’s largest children’s hospital are a horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. He was speaking on the eve of a Nato summit in Washington where leaders are expected to present a “historic” aid package for Ukraine, including air defences. Observers expect Nato members to pledge at least four additional Patriot missile batteries. Zelenskiy had previously asked Nato for seven batteries, saying that Putin “must be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again … And it depends fully on your choice … [the] choice whether we are indeed allies.”

>Western and UN leaders condemned Monday’s strikes, which saw Ukraine’s main treatment centre for children with cancer, take a direct missile hit. British prime minister Keir Starmer condemned “attacking innocent children” as the “most depraved of actions”, while the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, called the missile strike a “war crime”. A spokesperson for António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he strongly condemned the “particularly shocking” strikes against the children’s hospital and another medical facility. UN rights chief Volker Türk condemned the Russian strikes as “abominable”. France’s foreign ministry called the bombardment of a children’s hospital “barbaric” and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau described the attack as “abhorrent”. Russia has claimed the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defence systems and that it was striking only military targets.

>Witnesses in Kyiv have described how children – some as young as 18 months old and suffering kidney problems – had to be hurriedly taken off dialysis and evacuated through the building’s windows after the missile strike on Okhmatdyt children’s hospital. Nurse Tanya Lapshina said the strike came at a time when the hospital was at its busiest, and she feared for a child who was undergoing open-heart surgery at the time. Lapshina said her ward managed to bring the children to the shelter just minutes before the strike. “It was absolute chaos. The children were panicked, crying in the bunker. There are no words for this. It’s awful. I’m still shaking.” Images from inside the hospital, which treats 20,000 patients annually, showed bloodied children, collapsed ceilings and destroyed operating rooms.

>The UN security council is to meet on Tuesday at the request of Britain, France, Ecuador, Slovenia and the US.

"> Three unconditional conclusions in connection with the deliberate missile strike (X-101 class missiles) on Ukraine's largest children's hospital ""#Okhmatdyt""...

> 1. This is a fully deliberate action, specifically designed and approved by the entity Putin. On the eve of the @NATO summit. As a slap in the face to the alliance. Rf sends an informal signal to all about the following: ""even the outright murder of children will not make them (the Alliance) take all the necessary decisions. And that is why we continue to attack""...

> 2. Literally, in parallel with the deliberate attack on children in the Ukrainian capital, the leaders of Hungary and China once again demanded ""an immediate ceasefire"". This demand is not directed at #Russia. It is directed only at the West and #Ukraine. And its purpose is to create a false feeling: the aggressor has the right to kill, because he speaks of ""peace"", and the victim should not defend himself and therefore should immediately stop resistance. Leaving the territories and their own citizens to the aggressor... It looks extremely not natural and absolutely stimulates Russia to continue attacking...

> 3. Right now, the country that deliberately launched a massive strike on Ukrainian cities and a children's medical facility in Kyiv continues to preside over the... @UN Security Council. This is an absolutely blasphemous signal to all neutral countries that there are no rules and outright cannibalization is encouraged. Moreover, there is no proper UN response, which directly points to the obvious: if the war does not end with Russia's total defeat, the world is in for a terrible short history of bloody chaos... Where life has no value and death is the new synonym for the word ""russia"".

>These sanctions mainly target “businesspersons, propagandists, members of the armed forces and judiciary, persons responsible for the deportation of Ukrainian children” and members of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), it said.

>The newly sanctioned entities include companies operating in Russia’s defence industry and firms in the financial and trade sectors involved in circumventing sanctions, it added. This meant that more than 2,200 individuals and entities are now subject to the sanctions listings, the ministry said. “This is in line with the EU,” the statement added.

"This is a smaller news story, about life in *русский мир*:

In multiple villages in the occupied Melitopol area, there hasn’t been water for 4 months.  Getting the villagers water hasn’t been a priority for the Russian occupiers, despite the heat.  Those villagers are forced to buy water at the market and transport it back. However, it is a scam—there is no agency that oversees its quality and is simply a way the occupiers are able to enrich themselves.  There’s dozens of villages in this situation for 4 months.

Other villages around Melitopol who, up to now, have had running water, have just encountered a new, different problem.  With no prior notice, and only informed afterwards, the price of water (measured by cubic meter consumed) has risen 20%, back dated to July 1. 

Further, there’s no more online payments allowed (people were paying from other regions, so they could keep their empty houses until liberation) and everyone has to physically go to a post office to pay their suddenly increased bill in person, and must show a Russian passport.  Payments are only now accepted at the local post office.  Since there’s multiple villages without post offices but did have running water, now those villages won’t be getting water.

The water comptroller for occupied Zaporizhye region said that he wasn’t opposed to allowing online payments, but that this order for exclusively in-person payments was coming ‘from above.’  This blame-shifting led the reporter for *Ria-Melitopol* to close with this:

> This new method of payment for water service is undoubtedly a way for the occupiers to continue determining which are the unoccupied houses and apartments—because many evacuated Melitopol residents continued to pay utility bills monthly, even via their friends, so as not to attract attention to their property and the Russians subsequently deem the property ‘ownerless.’  A similar situation is now occurring in the villages of the Berdyansk region.",41,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.928, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.5048}",0.049,0.928,0.023,-0.5048

>Reuters calculations based on statements and Ukrainian media reports put the total amount donated to the hospital so far from Ukraine’s corporate sector at about 300 million hryvnia ($7.3m; £5.7m).

"Russia lacks munitions, troops for big Ukraine offensive, says NATO official

>WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuters) - Russia lacks the munitions and troops to start a major offensive in Ukraine and needs to secure significant ammunition supplies from other countries beyond what it already has, a senior NATO official said on Tuesday.

>**The official told a briefing with reporters on condition of anonymity that Russian President Vladimir Putin was conducting a covert campaign in Europe of assassination plots, sabotage and arson to undermine the public's support for Ukraine.**

>""What we see today are still very high Russian losses. Russia is attempting to take ground. We've seen Ukrainian defences improve significantly,"" the NATO official said.

>He estimated that Russia would be able to sustain its war economy for three to four more years.

>Kyiv's forces have been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Moscow's troops maintain heavy offensive pressure and advance slowly in the east of Ukraine.

>NATO begins a three-day summit in Washington on Tuesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is attending more than 28 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

>The official said ""it will be some time"" before Ukraine has amassed the munitions and personnel it needs to mount new large-scale offensive operations.

>""We are seeing they're improving day by day,"" he added.

COVERT CAMPAIGN

>**NATO has responded to Russia's covert campaign to undermine European support for Ukraine by issuing two statements alerting Moscow that the alliance is aware of what it is doing, the official said.**

>**It has also significantly increased intelligence-sharing among alliance members so ""we have a common picture of what's happening,"" the official said.**

>**""The very first thing that you have to do when you're pushing back against something that Vladimir Putin believes is below the threshold...is to show him that we know what's happening,"" he said.**

>He also singled what he said was China's continuing provision of ""critical enabling pieces"" for drones, missiles and the Russian defence industry.

>The official said that Putin ""still thinks time is on his side"" and is willing to endure ""truly staggering numbers of military casualties"". Russia was recruiting about 30,000 troops per month, allowing it to sustain large battlefield losses, he said.

"[Investigation: EU Shell-Production Capacity, Supplies To Ukraine Fall Far Short Of Promises](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-weapons-shells-european-union-eu-war-russia-investigation/33025300.html)

>The European Union's capacity to produce 155 mm artillery ammunition may be less than half as large as public estimates by senior EU officials indicate, affecting the bloc's ability to keep promises about supplies to Ukraine, Schemes and its partners in a journalistic investigation have found.

>The finding is a result of months of reporting by Schemes -- the investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service -- and other outlets in a consortium of European media on shell production, a crucial factor in Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion.

>In addition to the capacity issue, interviews with ammunition producers, buyers, government officials, policy advisers, and defense experts in EU member states and Ukraine showed that the EU has given Ukraine about half as many shells as it has promised, with a significant delay.

>In March, the European Commission said that thanks to its measures, European annual production capacity for 155 mm shells had reached 1 million a month earlier.

>Three months later, in June, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, said that EU producers would reach an annual capacity of 1.7 million 155 mm shells by the end of this year and that capacity would continue to grow. However, according to a high-ranking European arms industry source, the current capacity is about one-third of this.

>""It's a very bad idea to convince ourselves that we have three times the actual production capacity and make decisions based on that. Then suddenly to find out that nothing is coming out of the factories and you cannot supply Ukraine and the NATO alliance,"" the source said.

>Like some others cited in this report, the source spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.

>This testimony aligns with that of two other knowledgeable industry sources journalists spoke to in June -- high-level officials in an EU country and in Ukraine -- who assessed the annual capacity of European 155 mm ammunition production at over half a million.

>""Declarations of the EU leaders regarding the 155 mm production capacity that is to be reached by the end of this year are not reasonable. Production increases across Europe are lagging behind, with the current total capacity reaching about 580,000 shells per year,"" said a well-informed artillery industry source from Slovakia.

>Two other documents estimate the European industry's annual capacity as of the beginning of the year at not much higher than half a million.

>According to a December 2023 Estonian Defense Ministry report, the EU production capacity is about 600,000 shells a year. This fits with German arms maker Rheinmetall's January 2024 estimate, an internal document that journalists obtained, which says that all Western European arms makers taken together could produce around 550,000 shells annually as of the beginning of this year.

Long term contracts are still not being made:

>Even so, NAMMO is risking investing in capacity expansion. The company plans to triple production of 155 mm rounds at its plant in the Finnish city of Sastamala by 2026, although it has not yet received orders for this additional capacity. According to Colonel Mikko Millikangas , the top manager responsible for relations with the main customer of the company - the Finnish armed forces, the company will invest 200 million euros in its Finnish facilities alone.

>Other European manufacturers interviewed by journalists also claim that they are gradually increasing investments in their own capacities, despite the lack of government contracts.

Not all projectiles produced in the EU are sent to Ukraine:

>EU countries keep ammunition for themselves. They have to replenish their own stocks, after they give Ukraine the shells they had. In addition, they are trying to meet NATO's requirement that they have enough ammunition in their warehouses for 30 days of possible high-intensity combat.

>""I think there are maybe only a few countries in Europe that have 30 days of 155 mm projectile stocks ( of possible high-intensity combat - ed. ),"" Estonian Defense Ministry Permanent Secretary Kusti Salm said in a comment to Delfi Estonia .

>""The warehouses are empty, that's understandable. NATO's target indicators for the armed forces have also not been achieved,"" confirmed the Director of the State Defense Investment Center of Estonia (RKIK), Magnus-Valdemar Saar .

>""The fact that European countries are keeping some of their ammunition against the background of Russia's war against Ukraine is justified by their ""national interests and national security,"" a senior official of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine told ""Schemes"" on the condition of anonymity.

>""If Europe did not take into account its national interests and national security, then probably, considering that there is no war in them, they would simply give us all the Patriots and would have closed our skies a long time ago.

- Russians are using ""internal displacement"" deportations to perform ethnic cleansing in occupied areas of Ukraine, with the excuse of ""safety evacuations""...

A section of the game world is ruled by iron fist Vampires who have enslaved a whole bunch of humans on their land and they take “blood tithes” where they drain some blood from each person, but not enough to kill them so they have a continuous supply of blood. There is a thing called the theatre of blood that of a person were to survive, they are set free. Thing is, the theatre is a complete death trap. No citizen of the this area would ever be able to survive it’s genuinely impossible. The vampires created a story around the theatre that in the past one brave champion had in fact competed the theatre, and escaped their bondage. That story was a lie made up by the vampires. No one had ever survived. The woman who was supposed to have done it was actually turned into a horrible abomination and she now is the very first boss you face in theatre, the people hero, killing all who enter immediately. But the story prevails, no one who enters is able to tell anyone outside how impossible the task is, and so the taste of hope remains, and every day more people throw themselves at this hope with no chance of ever winning. 

The whole thing is an allegory for the rich. They convince regular folks that they could make it to the top. If you just tried a little harder, worked a little more, have as little fun as possible, you too one day could be super rich. 

Becoming super rich in the real world is technically achievable, but that’s why the Taste of Hope is so effective. All of the poorest conservatives genuinely believe if they make their boss super rich it will somehow make them super rich. They feel like those bosses and landlords “earned” that money. They “deserve it. And they think that stuff not because they actually believe it, but because if they were ever to finally break through and become rich, they would want to horde all that wealth for themselves just like the people who currently have money.

The republicans have no need to do that when their judges have a majority in court, so your argument is moot there.


Besides, the court is openly corrupt. You have judges taking gifts, then refusing to recuse when the donor subsequently has a trial before the court. You have judges openly admitting to making rulings based on ideological grounds.  You have judges pulling shit out their ass and basing rulings on some obsolete 1700s belief that has absolutely no relevancy in a modern ruling. (Mostly Alito and Thomas). You also had one where the then president blocked an investigation into sexual assault claims so they could get on the court.


The problem is that the standard way of dealing with corrupt judges is impeachment, but we already know that's not going to happen. The only other alternative is to stack the court and undermine the corruption that way.

These people in the past have mostly been ignored. Knowing that they will likely vote Republican either way, most Republicans just ignore them and count on their vote. Then Trump comes in and directly courts them, stoking their fears and giving them political relevance. Something no one has ever really done before. No Presidential candidate in recent memory has ever pandered to all the fringe nut job groups out there. You have to realize that the US has a lot of white males that work blue collar jobs and are “racist”. Trump galvanized all these people and conned them into thinking he cares about them. That he will help them.

Then you have all the rich people that just see Trump as purely good for the bottom line. Lower taxes, less IRS, simply good for the bank account. They know he’s awful for the country, for the environment, everything else, but they don’t care because greed wins every time and Trump is better for their bank account.

Next you have all the people that have agendas that they know they can push through if Trump wins. Trumps middle name is quid pro quo. So everyone that has been looking for a President to buy over the last several decades has found by far their best opportunity. Trump is too busy watching TV all day to deal with pesky policy decisions, so the people that have managed to complement him the most, and therefore get cushy govt positions in his administration, are able to push through whatever they’re getting paid to push through.  

2 out of 3 of these groups likely don’t even like Trump. They just no he’s a stooge that will let them do what they want. 

So don’t be fooled that some 80 million people actually like Trump. 80 million people are willing to put their own interests over the good of the country and the world.",13,"{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9855}",0.063,0.809,0.128,0.9855

The problem is that our judiciary systems (worldwide) are too slow to respond. She might get indicted and even convicted, but then there will be years (more?) of appeals, motions, etc. Meanwhile, for her and the National Rally, it's just business/grift as usual.

With the current judicial systems (in France and also worldwide and now USoA) it is unlikely that her or the National Rally will actually see any prosecution soon. This delay is an important issue, a major factor that the Putin/Russians and others are now taking advantage of. With good results! Even this 'loss' is a good result. 

Authoritarian Regimes like Russia and China have a big advantage; they can act very quickly and amorally. Without judicial/court delays, they can move rapidly to avoid both local and international prosecution (hey, they just bombed a children's hospital, and there is little or no response). They take advantage of the 'moral' nation's overlong judicial reviews and long response time, to do whatever they want, in the often years-long meantime.

Obviously.

Americans are just obsessed with the subject because they want to create a false balance and they're uncomfortable with the fact that fascism has become ubiquitous. And that they, as a society, have been the primary driver of its recent success. That, and post-truth politics.

Edit: also, I forgot to mention, there is a tactic that goes a little something like this: the American far-right is extremely conspiratorial. So when they first coalesce around a fascist like Trump, organize armed, masked militias who jump out of U-hauls to terrorize city centers, then subsequently attempt a coup d'état, they will always blame their own attacks on a ""false flag"" by the far-left afterward. They can have it both ways. They can intimidate and attack and simultaneously create a fictional narrative about a spooky, non-existent ""opposing army"" of Leninists.

I mean your point is ignorant and dangerous, and not every progressive movement is good or healthy. Do me a favor and look into the post WWII progressives who went so far anti Nazi, they created state sponsored pedophilia, where abandoned and orphaned children were placed with caregivers the authorities knew full well were diddling them. Read some of the accounts of adults who knew full well they didn’t like diddling children, but did so because it was a leftist and progressive action and anti-Nazi, because sexual freedom is anti Nazi. The same argument you are leaning into is exactly what those people believed.

Or how about right now, what should be considered the age of the information will go down as the age of plastic for all of this Indestructible waste that we are littering our biosphere with? I bet using plastic for everything was really progressive in the 1960s. Hell until the early 1990s in school we were encouraged to use plastic in our “progressive” recycling education programs, because it could be reused and was less resource intensive than other cleaner greener materials. 

The entire point of my argument is that the 2 sides are supposed to serve equal and opposite functions in a healthy society. Progressives push for change and to move society forward while conservatives are more wait and see and steer the course. As an analogy, progressives are the sail to a sail boat while conservatives are the rudder. Both are as important as the other and serve a function that can’t be complete without each other. 


Being “progressive” isn’t inherently a good thing on its own if you don’t have an actual platform you are rallying for, it ends up spinelessly sending children to pedophiles and littering plastic everywhere for progress for the sake of progress, which is not an inherently good thing. 

Btw I am also a progressive, but your whole “shun them under a rock” and response reading like your class just finished reading the communist manifesto is wholly inaccurate and dangerous.

"I mean I disagree with their thesis entirely. Progress for the sake of progress is not a good thing.

1. For all the US sins, and there are many, this isn't even a remotely realistic scenario. They've done more for human rights and liberties than most countries despite their faults.


2. If the USA directly invaded another country and tried to take it over,  countries like the UK would not support it because it would mean the US would have done a complete 180 on their values and everything they are meant to stand for, on the system of international law they helped create and would no longer be a reliable partner.

McCain was 100% spot on. The only way Putin knows how to operate is by exploiting every single weakness he can.

Everyone who worries about escalation, or who calls for a Ukraine ceasefire, or says Ukraine shouldn't be allowed to attack Russian territory, or that Ukraine shouldn't use certain equipment/missiles/vehicles, etc is ENCOURAGING Putin to escalate the war further.

This whole war would have been avoided if Ukraine was part of NATO.

The war would have finished a lot sooner if we gave tanks, long range missiles and planes sooner.

The war would have been over sooner if we had allowed Ukraine to attack Russian soil sooner.

Ukraine has done an incredible job standing up to the ""second army in the world"", and shown it to be a paper tiger. Save Ukrainian lives, reduce the overall cost of the war, prevent further destruction by giving Ukraine EVERYTHING it needs to kick every last Russian boot out of Ukraine. That will stop Russia from pursuing aggressive colonial expansion.

Anyone who knows anything about Russia, like McCain, warned about Russian invasion years ago.

Prior to that they claimed that counteroffensive will be successful because the western tanks are so superior Russian army will run away on sight.

None of the “super weapons” turned out to be super weapons. That would be one of the reasons not a lot SAM systems are sent to Ukraine. Or F-16. It would be bad for sales. I mean, Russian weapons sales took a hit when people found out how far the tank turrets can fly.

But the fact USA doesn’t allow Ukraine to hit Russian airfields could not only be that (if Russia figures out how to intercept the missiles, NATO would be in a trouble in a direct conflict), but also the fact that all the little amount of help is being sent for Ukraine just stand a little longer until (hopefully for NATO) Russia is exhausted (they’re close to it).

> Rescuers have continued to dig through the rubble of a children&#039;s hospital in Kyiv after a wave of devastating Russian missile strikes across the country on Monday that killed 38 people, including four children.

> The White House in May allowed Kyiv for the first time to attack enemy troops and weapons systems in locations just across the border, in Russia&#039;s Belgorod region, that were used as a staging post for raids into Kharkiv oblast but Ukraine cannot use long-range artillery to take out the Russian military airfields, which took part in Monday&#039;s and other attacks.

> Russia&#039;s state media largely ignored the attack on the children&#039;s hospital.

 It was always overloaded with tourists in the summer, like totally booked hotels, lines for natural attractions, traffic didn't really exist, but we had a version of it in some areas. Prices would go up, but the good that came with it. The food was excellent, 3 months of heavy tourism gave us a year-round food scene that was out of this world. It's a small town. Everyone knew a hookup at every local place, so even in the summer, getting a table and a few free apps was easy enough. Got to keep the year-round money happy as a business owner. 


The air bnb situation was the real killer. The absolute lack of affordable housing ate the city from the inside out. Nobody was making great money, especially young people, where most jobs are tourism related. But if you could afford to live, the city was its own reward. But we all stopped being able to afford to live. The long-term rentals were in disrepair, and the city was reluctant to approve multi family properties because it would affect the charm of the town. We didn't lack more space to grow, but the environmental faction didn't want the city to encroach on the natural areas. So it stagnated. 


Covid was really the final straw. If you had money, you bought an airbnb, and those without saw the last path to living there disappear. So I understand the frustration, but it was never the tourists fault. The tourists kept so much of what I loved about the town alive. The food and culture bring people in, and I got that year round.

Someone has to own the ski hill. There were retired public school teachers with multiple airbnbs. It felt like an impossible thing.

Destruction of the Kharkova Dam

Literally tens of thousands of war crimes committed by russia against innocent women, children, and defenders of Ukraine.

Sponsored and supported by russian citizens' apathy and outright support of something they don't even have the decency to call a war. This systematic genocide of a sovereign nation amounts to something they call special. 

""Ukraine is investigating the suspected beheading of one of its servicemen by Russian forces in an occupied part of the eastern Donetsk region"", the Ukrainian general prosecutor's office said on Tuesday.

Russian soldiers reportedly killed an old man on a wheelchair. 

The man tried to drive away from the medical facility, but Russians shot him and threw him in the middle of a street in Vovchansk, near the Central Railway Station.

Genocide, what Russia does is genocide. Hitting mental hospitals or people in wheelchairs/with other disabilities is reminding me of Operation T4, the systematic killings of people with disabilities by the Nazis.

Genocide is a human phenomenon. According to Gregory H. Stanton, genocide is a process that develops in ten stages, described here. The stages do not necessarily follow a linear progression and may coexist. Prevention measures may be implemented at any stage.

1. Classification (has happened in Ukraine by classifying them as ""Nazis"" or ""Khokols"" in an us vs. them mentality)

2. Symbolisation ( making people stand out with certain clothing or symbols) This hasn't happened to a larger extent I think)


3. Discrimination (The dominant group creates laws that deny rights to the other group, denial of full civil rights etc.) Russia is doing that on a large scale with Ukraine and its own minorities.


4. Dehumunisation (propaganda that draws parallels with insects, vermin, etc. to dehumanize the group)


5. Organisation (Militia or army designs detailed organized killing plans) that happened the very moment Russia entered Ukraine, Bucha is just one of many examples)


6. Polarization (Propaganda is employed to amplify the differences between groups. Interactions between groups are prohibited, and the moderate members of the group in power are killed) Russia and its supporters do that on an hourly basis on and offline and on all Russian TV channels, calling for the murder or torture of Ukrainians etc.)


7. Preparation

The victims are identified, separated, and forced to wear symbols. Deportations, isolation, and forcible starvation. Death lists are drawn up.
Russia did that and was about to execute these plans on a larger scale, but Western intervention in the war could stop this process from spreading.

8. Persecution (isolation of victims based on nationality, ethnic group or religion, victims might be forced to wear specific symbols, that process is ongoing in the occupied territories and Ukrainians are subject to massive repression especially when they refuse to be russified)

9. Extermination (perpetrators kill at will and without mercy, don't see their victims as entirely human, they view it as a necessary evil. This also happened in Ukraine again and again on a large scale. we are talking tens or even hundreds of thousands by now.

10. Denial 

The perpetrators of the genocide deny having committed their crimes. Victims are often blamed. Evidence is hidden, and witnesses are intimidated. The Russian goal is genocide and that is what the West must finally prevent, and we fail at doing so. Shameful is what comes to mind.

Russia shot people on the street and killed them with drones, unarmed civilians, of course, but that doesn't stop the genocidal Russian army. It rather spurs them on. To investigate the crime is great, retaliation strikes would be more effective. This won't stop unless superior firepower makes Russia stop.",271,"{'neg': 0.22, 'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.9996}",0.22,0.728,0.051,-0.9996

"I know what international law is, which is a joke. I just don’t think many people who blindly support Israel sees how much this hurts Israel’s cause in the long run. The whole world should have learned you don’t uproot terrorists from impoverished places by demolishing the infrastructure and killing civilians. That usually makes more terrorists, not less. 

I also think Hamas is completely vile and should be eliminated. I just don’t agree with the methods Israel is choosing to use to accomplish the goal and think it’s detrimental and the only reason they are being this hawkish on everyone in that region is they know they have a blank check from the U.S.  

I’d also argue that these laws were made shortly after WWII when a uniformed army is much different than Hamas. To me, it’s not morally nor should it be legally okay to target an area because it has combatants and 90% of the occupants are civilians. 

We could make the exact same argument for how Russia has struck targets in Ukraine that they claim has legitimate military targets but were mainly civilians. It’s dead wrong when they target civilians too and I know Russia does it more, but Israel also does the same thing and we give them a blanket pass because “they’re hiding amongst civilians”.

This is another reason we should strive for diplomacy and now just have a win-lose outcome. We are allowing the blanket killing of thousands of civilians because we think in the long run it serves our interest. We should have learned during the 20th century a foreign policy of playing God has only backfired on us. But instead we’re licking up everything we’re told by corrupt individuals at the pentagon. 

Remember the documents the air guard member leaked where internally the Pentagon acknowledged Ukraine couldn’t win the war and at best it would be a years long stalemate and bloodbath? While we were publicly told Ukraine was winning and going to win. It’s just yet another reason I don’t know why we’ve lost our minds and buy into this war is okay instead of trying to use diplomacy and end it. It’s also why we’re losing standing in the world.

What happening is similar to the Dutch Disease effect. The short term boom of a sudden influx of cash into one dominant industry in an economy boosts GDP values and looks good overall. However the long term effects are quite negative. The dominance of one industry (defense in this case) sucks up all the capital in an economy and causes the rest of it to stagnate and decline. Combine this lack of long term investment in productive tools for the economy with Russias demographic declines and it’s not great for them in the future.

"Of course, but his point is that the relation higher GDP = stronger economy usually works because of the re investment loop (you reinvest in future growth, infrastructure, education, so the next cycle is stronger, reinvest, stronger, etc ...).

But if you get higher GDP without reinvesting then it doesn't lead to a stronger economy, you've merely exhausted your ressources. It's not that different from you. If you suddenly have a million it usually lead to you being richer because you invest it. But if you blow it all on cocaine and hookers, then tomorrow you're back to where you started (see : Trump).

We have many precedent for countries, in different direction. For a good exemple of war economy is not real economy : Nazi Germany had a massive GDP growth through rearmement but then was essentially broke and about to explode when they started invading other countries (and steal their gold and resources to try and refill the coffers). For a need to reinvest : venezuela had a lot of money before wasting it all on everything BUT infrastructure needed.

So yes Russia's GDP is growing again, and yes they have resources to keep it going a while. But make no mistake, this is making themselves stronger now and for the next 2 to 8 years, at the cost of everything in 10 to 30 years.

First was a chap who had been in a vegetative state for about a year, just staring into space, dribbling in his lap who suddenly jumped up in his bedroom and for a good five minutes was whooping for joy, bouncing on his bed like a five year old, hollaring and shouting....then he dropped down dead with a smile on his face. 
It was like someone had slipped him a terminal happy pill.

The other was more disturbing.

We had a tv lounge with a single tv and a remote. All the residents would discuss what they wanted to watch and then whoever had the remote would switch over.

Bill had the remote this day and everyone asked him to turn over a channel and when he did an old senile lady who had arms like matchsticks absolutely lost it. Screaming she dragged Bill out of his wheelchair and threw him onto the floor, then started smashing his head into the wooden floor while four of us tried to get her off him.

She literally had insane strength and try as I might I couldn’t even peel her fingers away from his head until finally one guy got her round the neck and choked her until she weakened and let go. By that time Bill’s head was a right mess and he was rushed to hospital where he sadly died of his head injuries.

The matron called the police who turned up, heard what happened and left just a quickly with no further action. The old dear was moved to another home the same day but nothing ever happened and I believe Bill’s family were told he had a tragic accident falling from his wheel chair.

But the only benefit anyone has in mind when approving US military spending is their own / their donors' in the MIC / their constituents' working jobs in the MIC and the country's security, economical and geopolitical power (in that order).

Now for why you don't have universal healthcare and we do: Because it runs counter to profit-making and rent-seeking and the billionaire class has captured your media and political sphere and convinced half of your population to repeatedly vote against their own best interest and for their continued exploitation by feeding them fear, hate and misinformation for decades.

You actually *pay a lot more* per capita on healthcare compared to european countries with universal healthcare. It's not that you can't afford it because of your military spending. You spend more so a handful of people get to make billions of off your healthcare. 

You would actually *safe money* as a country by switching to universal healthcare.",6,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9438}",0.062,0.798,0.14,0.9438
