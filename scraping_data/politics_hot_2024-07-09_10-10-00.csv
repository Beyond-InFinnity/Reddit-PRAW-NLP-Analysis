I'll simply leave it at that. The USA is the country most closely resembling a wish granted by a monkey's paw."", 15], ['Some things to consider: \n\nJohn Fetterman had an arguably worse debate performance then Joe Biden did. John literally had a stroke and people thought he had brain damage. The Pennsylvania subs and social media said he was finished, conservative media and some liberal media ate him alive. Polls shifted for Dr. Oz and it appeared to be an easy victory for Repubs. Fetterman won by 5 points.\n\nAll secondary candidates who were floated as potential selections to replace Joe Biden have all categorically said no. Gov Whitmer went as far as to say people need to stop mentioning her name and running for president. They\'ve all endorsed Joe Biden. So it\'s odd that media-social media wants Biden replaced but never says who/how?\n\nNew poll of voters who prefer to face Donald Trump. Biden or Harris. Biden up by 15 points.\n\nDennis Hof, owner of the Moonlight Bunny Ranch Motel (Legal Prostitution in Nevada) ran as a Conservative. Got the Christian Conservative vote. Won his election. However he DIED before he could take office. Partied with hookers and cocaine. People still voted for him. \n\nAll the damage, astro turfing, anger towards Joe Biden, horrible debate performance, missteps, blunders, media fury towards Joe, social media wrath, etc etc. shows Biden is still only down 2 points nationally. Aggregate polls show its still a 50/50. Latest polls out of Michigan and Wisconsin show he\'s actually up now. \n\nSince Roe v Wade Democrats have shown massive turnout gaps vs. Republicans.\n\n  \nThe takeaway?\n\nSocial media is NOT REAL! If people are taking grand stands on social media it has nill effect on actual elections. Vivek Ramaswamy had an amazing social media push, trending heavily and couldn\'t even muster double digit votes on election day. Nikki Haley was trashed on social media, said birdbrain won\'t get a single vote.. She continued to take 10% - 15% away from Trump long after she suspended her campaign.\n\nIssues matter. People who actually vote look at the party and platform. \n\nDebates don\'t matter. Fetterman, Biden, Obama (1st vs Romney), George W. Bush, Kennedy all did poorly or worse in their debates. They all went on to win the Presidency.\n\nEvery campaign faces difficulties. Every campaign has challenges. No campaign goes unscathed. Never. Clinton had women coming out with sexual assault claims. Obama a muslim terrorist, socialist, born in Kenya, Trump with Jeffery Epstein, Hilary and her emails, benghazi. Biden\'s is he\'s old and doesn\'t speak well. Out of all the issues that\'s the easiest to manage. \n\nLast takeaway!\n\nDo not convince yourself (If you\'re a liberal) that Trump should be \'easy\'. He\'s not. He\'s a tough candidate, fights like hell for his beliefs, and will go to any depth to win. He\'s the toughest candidate the Democrats have had to face in decades. There isn\'t ""JOE SHOULD BE UP BY 10!!"" No! Trumps populism resonates VERY WELL, don\'t underestimate him. \n\n  \nSo relax, disengage from social media. Vote based on policy and issues and understand this election is far from over.', 15], ['Its kinda wild that one gets accused of astroturfing for acknowledging Biden\'s poor performance in the polls and driving apathy leading to low voter turnout that will do the opposite of how French left shocked the polls with historic voter turn out.\n\nAnd then they regurgitate the same ""This random guy who predicted 9 out of 10 elections said keep Biden in"" (which isn\'t even that impressive, heck the average Joe probably got 7-8 out of the last 10 right"". Or they acuse the media of pushing a narrative and then use phrases like ""If Biden drops out who get the money"" or ""if biden drops out they will challenge the ballots"" which are themselves media driven narratives. Probably put out by Biden\'s camp to put fear in the unknown of a new candidate.\n\nHaving discussions about who should be the democrat nominee 8 weeks before the damn convention isn\'t infighting or eating our own. No matter who comes out on top dems will rally behind. I dont think genuine conversation can even be really had because it feels like Bidenists are yelling ""GET OUT AND VOTE"" to people who are already voting for Biden, neglecting the millions of ""I wont vote for Biden trump round 2"" protest voters and independent/soft 3rd party voters that are just not accessable with the current Biden campaign that will determine the election.\n\nI also hate the ""Who is a viable candidate?"" condescending question. Each swing state had a democratic senate candidate polling far far ahead of Biden; it\'s a Biden issue not a democrat issue. Name recognition is cool in theory but we have to appreciate the uniqueness of each situation as well. There is a hungry populace wanting to vote for someone not Biden or Trump, that republicans can\'t access but democrats potentially could. All the alternatives poll marginally behind Biden but also have higher upside, the ability to attract previous novote/apathetics leading to higher turnout that polls dont show (see France) and hell dem internal polling shows Whitmer ahead (for example) in swing states from that OpenLabs leak a week ago.\n\nWe need an energized candidate who isn\'t restricted to pre 8pm and one to two scripted showings a week and a teleprompter read. We need anyone who is free 24/7 to shout to the roof tops about the threats of Project 2025, about how disasterous a wealth tax cut would lead to worsening inflation and house prices, etc. etc. To put Trumps faults out in view at every moment instead of struggling to get their own talking points out while coming off as abrasive, clueless, and arrogant. It\'s going to get worse for Biden as his decline worsens and the obvious cover ups hurt the campaign image more and give even more fuel to the media (who no doubt would find faults with a new candidate but nothing as errosive as Biden\'s legitimate decline) and take away even more from why this election is so damn important', 15], ['It is so absurd that Biden has not had a live, non-scripted public appearance since the debate and hardly any throughout his presidency.\n\nIt’s like a sci-fi concept, the country is being ran by a teleprompter.\n\nI don’t personally think thats true to the full extent but the fact that I don’t have enough info to know Biden isn’t always like he was in the debate when unscripted is crazy.', 15], [""To add to this: if you're struggling to just forget about what's going on around us, you can pick an era of political strife you're interested in or one that speaks to concerns you have about today, and then find podcasts/videos/books about the people who were fighting for change during those times. Learn what kept them going when things looked hopeless. History is full of fighters and helpers who we should all be learning from."", 15], ['Politics are so polarized here that very few people will ever vote for the other party. Swing voters think Biden is responsible for inflation so that’s probably their main reason to consider Trump.', 15], ['We have tried nothing and are all out of ideas', 15], [""I don't think so. The debate was survivable, but the campaign's response was abysmal. The posture of this was also different than Obama's meltdown or Clinton's emails even. The grassroots have been concerned about Biden's age for at least a year or two now, and have been told that they're overreacting by elites who continued to push the idea that he was fine. What's cracking right now are those elites, and they're aligning with concerns that rank and file Democrats have had all along. \n\nThe response Biden's doing right now is barely treading water at a time when he's down in the polls and would not win an election if it were held today. The money advantage he had is also unsustainable, with GOP donors already starting to launch their ad campaigns after holding their powder dry for months while Biden had uncontested control of the airwaves. Biden was down $45M with cash on hand to Trump, and Trump has no major lawsuits to drain money now anymore either. \n\nThe panic is that there is no plan, because there is no fixing the issue of Biden being old. If he were 8 years younger, he could go out and barnstorm the swing states, do a couple pressers, and then hit up a bunch of town halls to completely dismiss the health issue. Instead, he's done scripted campaign rallies, scripted fundraisers, radio interviews where he's evidently reading off notes and giving questions to the hosts, and a short 22 minute long televised interview with a somewhat friendly anchor where he doesn't really assuage any concerns. \n\nThis is not Hillary in 2016 because this isn't something outside of the campaign or the Democratic Party's control like the Comey letter was. I didn't think the age concerns were severe until the debate, but it's a valid question of what shape he'll be in come 2027 or 2028."", 15], [""It's not just the polls. It's Biden's actual condition.

Please Joe, just do the right thing', 14], ['Why is no one challenging Biden’s new talking point that people said he couldn’t win in 2020?\n\nLiterally every poll had him up, on average by 7 points. Nearly ever major publication predicted he would win.

Parading staffers out to defend him isn’t going to change anyone’s mind. No one trusts them anymore because they’ve been telling us he’s fine and we’ve seen for ourselves now that he’s not fine. We need to see more of Biden taking questions unscripted so we can all feel comfortable that he’s competent and the debate was just a bad night. Without that, these questions aren’t going to stop', 14], [""This is what I've seen so far about this:\n\n1. Biden's age is the top concern about him and has been for as long as the cycle has run. The campaign was hoping to put that issue to rest with a debate performance but that's completely failed. Trump has invested a lot of money and effort to talk about age being an important issue. There is some hope that, if Harris replaces Biden, all that effort blows back on Trump as people start looking at Trump's noticeable verbal gaffes too.\n\n2. The GCB, especially for vulnerable Democrats, is remarkably resilient, meaning the weakness is entirely coming from Biden. That suggests an appetite for a Democratic nominee who isn't Biden, even if the H2H polls don't show that with other challengers.\n\n3. Biden's weakness is with young people and people of color. Harris heading the ticket could reinvigorate the base and bring those voters back into the fold. \n\n4. Harris (and possibly Beshear as her running mate) is a prosecutor and, besides being a much better communicator, can immediately cast the race as an issue that focuses on Trump's many alleged crimes and what he's been convicted of. \n\n5. Harris inherits the campaign account, so she isn't at a financial disadvantage. Donors are already starting to dry up a bit now, with a Wisconsin fundraiser that was expected to raise $1M (later estimated down to $500K) being canceled for lack of interest. There's a clear push by donors to invest downballot right now, which is unlikely to slow down if Biden stays on.\n\n5. Biden isn't going to get better. This isn't a bad night like Obama's debate, his age issues are known and he isn't going to get any younger.

Rather, it was the days after the debate where this whole thing went to hell. The Biden campaign spent the better part of a year telling people that it had a plan and that it would execute that plan like a well oiled machine. That\'s what Democrats and Democratic donors believed even as the polls were looking bad for them despite the improving economic situation. When the debate happened (which was itself scheduled early as part of that master plan), Democrats were anxious, but people had faith that the Democratic machine would figure out how to course correct and rely on an already mapped out plan B or C to figure it out.\n\nInstead, none of that happened. Biden did have a decent day after the debate in a scripted rally, but there wasn\'t much of a plan afterwards. To make matters worse, the campaign got increasingly defensive, sending out press releases calling people bedwetters for questioning the plan and picking fights with podcasters all while saying that nothing was going to change, all while Biden himself seemed to be doing other things like a Vogue magazine photo shoot and campaign fundraising dinners where he had to use a teleprompter to get through a 5 minute speech in a small private venue. It wasn\'t until late Tuesday of last week that it even sounded like the campaign was getting together to map out a response, and that response has not been great, with scandals about giving questions out in advance to radio hosts and a disastrous response in the Stephanopoulous interview where he said he\'d be fine if he lost reelection as long as he tried his best undercutting the theme of his campaign in the first place being that Donald Trump is an existential threat to democracy.\n\nIt only feels like the response is exaggerated right now because it\'s been priced into the polling already. Biden was already down in the polls and the goal of an early debate was to turn that around. People, including many Democrats, already priced in that he\'s very old and not as sharp as he used to be, and that\'s why they don\'t register support for him in the polls to begin with. It also feels like an elite response rather than a grassroots one right now because elites are the ones who have been holding the line for him in the first place. Party elites aligned quickly behind Biden after he announced his plan for reelection to crowd out any potential rivals for the nomination, and large donor money is how he\'s built up a formidable war chest over the past year. This was despite longstanding concerns by the grassroots that Biden was too old, because elites felt that there was a plan to run off of by the campaign. Now that it\'s clear that there isn\'t one, and that Biden\'s response is just treading water at best all while being down in the polls in the first place, it\'s almost natural to see this kind of widespread panic in the party right now.\n\nThe Biden letter being publicized right now and Biden himself attacking elites all while more members of Congress defect is strongly indicative of how dire the situation is. If this were really just a couple rogue Congressmen, the President would not even dignify it with a response and rely on surrogates. Instead, his surrogates are mostly silent and not working to seriously rein in the panic among electeds. Biden himself also doesn\'t seem to have a solid diehard faction of the party, which is different from the calls to have Trump step down after Access Hollywood. His strongest supporters are members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Bernie Sanders, and some members of the Squad who have largely been silent. While that helps Biden for sure, it\'s hard for me to see the CBC or Sanders being inherently opposed to Harris winning the nomination instead if the situation were untenable. \n\nBiden\'s running out of time to turn this around, but if he seriously wanted to do that, he\'d be out there giving live televised interviews with morning shows beyond just his favorite Morning Joe, and offering to sit for town halls with every major network. Even if he flubs some words, the exposure makes this a bed of nails strategy that he can use to dull the effect of those gaffes in the media.

A priest in the village had once been able to fend off the vampire by holding out a cross. As time went on, the priest aged rapidly. Holding Dracula at bay was a very stressful job and it took a heavy toll on the old priest. \n\nOne night, Count Dracula slipped into the village and drained the blood from a young maiden while the bewildered old priest froze up, forgetting to hold up the cross. Any of the strong young villagers could have easily held out the cross to keep Dracula away, but the priest held on to the cross and wouldn’t give it up. The priest would not or maybe could not see that he was no longer able to protect the village from the evil vampire.\n\nIn a state of near panic, the Village Press printed a story about how the priest was no longer up to the task of fending off Dracula. The Village Press went on to suggest that maybe the village would be best served by a younger priest. One who could still fend off the vampire and keep the village safe.\n\nMany villagers agreed, but many villagers attacked the Village Press for not printing a story about evil Count Dracula instead of the failing old priest. The Village Press responded to the criticism in an editorial saying that, yes, we all agree, wholeheartedly, that Count Dracula is an evil vampire. And that is precisely the reason we believe the old priest must be replaced. We simply can’t depend on the old priest, with his age related limitations, to keep the village safe from the evil vampire. Surely all the villagers must see this to be true. After all, the vampire just claimed a young maiden from the village. And every day he announces what he plans to do once he gets hold of the village. To save yourselves, you must make a change.\n\nSadly, the village remained divided, with many villagers feeling very virtuous for their misplaced loyalty to the doddering old priest. Meanwhile, night after night, one by one, the villagers were set upon by Count Dracula, until finally, unable to persuade the priest to pass the cross off to a younger priest, the entire village perished.

The DNC is deciding if it’s worth to force a new candidate this late into the year, and any real contender will need both the party support and the incumbent’s blessing before they go forward but that’s still asking a politician to sign up against bad odds for their personal political career. You could argue that since Trump is going to adopt massive portions of project 2025 and schedule F that ANYONE would be a slam dunk but MAGA has politicians scared about their odds, they wanted the incumbent advantage. \n \nWith all that said our options are going to be Trump v Biden in November. I don’t like them, you don’t like them, random person in Australia doesn’t like them. The worst case scenario is that neither of these guys are going to do much and their administration will be doing the real work of president. So if we are forced to vote for the better cabinet then Biden should be winning hands down. His last 4 years have been a huge sigh of relief for this country and even if he hasn’t delivered everything as promised, we as a country haven’t been teetering on the edge of oblivion like under Trump. Compare that with 2024 Trump who unlike in ‘16 will have a handpicked cabinet chosen by the heritage foundation with the intent to strip basic rights and freedoms and reverse the last 100 years of equal rights laws. \n \nI’m going to vote straight Dem this election no mater who the candidate is because the negatives that a Trump presidency bring in my opinion far out weigh the criticisms I have for Biden and the DNC as a whole. The DNC is a bunch of idiots when it comes to winning elections but their track record for governing speaks for itself. The DNCs biggest weakness is their adherence to tradition which hampers their ability to win elections, move on urgent matters, and appeal to the general public, but we can’t fix the party if it doesn’t exist in 4 years, we can’t vote the right people in if they are ran out of office or imprisoned. If any of the SCOTUS rulings this past year have made you the least bit anxious or uneasy then the guy that put 3 of them on there to secure the majority shouldn’t be trusted with the office allowed to imprison political rivals, even if that means I have to vote for a really really really old guy. \n \nSome people need to think of this as paying your rent or your credit card bill.

If you’re serious about saving American democracy, you’ll vote blue no matter what. A vote for anyone else is a vote for Trump. \n\nYou know that Trump *will* end up ending American democracy if he gets reelected. You know that whomever the democrats end up putting on that ballot is the *only* person who has any shot at beating Trump from that point onwards, even if those chances are potentially minuscule. If the Democrats change their candidate, vote for the new candidate. If Democrats still send Biden, be angry about it but vote for him regardless. Vote blue down the ballot as well. I say this as a German whose great great grandpa was a social democrat in the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany. He was arrested and imprisoned three times under the Nazis. The first time was in the night from 9th to 10th March 1933, when the nazis on the “legal” basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree arrested Social Democratic, Communist, Socialist and other oppositional leading members of the Reichstag, in order to keep them from voting against the Enabling Act in the parliamentary vote on 23rd March 1933. \n\nThe Nazis held him at Dachau twice, once from late April to early May 1933, and then again from late August 1944 to the end. He died days after being liberated in May 1945 as a direct consequence of what the Nazis did to him. \n\nThey outlawed the freaking SPD, the Social Democratic Party as a terrorist organisation. For those who don’t know, the SPD is currently one of the ruling parties in Germany and obviously not a terrorist threat, nor were they one back then. They sentenced my great great grandfather to two and a half years in prison for possessing and distributing social democratic leaflets and magazines. \n\nYou Americans, you are currently in 1932, only the situation is a little more drastic. The Supreme Court already passed the Enabling Act for you. It took the Nazis until 24th March 1933 to sign it into law. If someone who will make use of it gets elected to the White House, you’re done. That’s it. Trump is that guy, both he and the Republican Party have been very open about that. \n\nYou get one shot at this. No matter how unable to function Biden seems, his staff and his VP and he himself in his limited capacities will at the very least protect your democracy to the best of their abilities. So knowing that whoever ends up being the Democratic nominee is the *only* person with any sort of chance to preserve your democracy, vote for whomever they end up nominating. If it’s someone new, cool. If it isn’t, it really doesn’t matter. Vote blue this time in order to get a choice next time. Biden can’t run in 2028. You *will* have an open primary for the 2028 election. I understand you want one now, and that’s okay, but if you don’t get it, make sure you vote in a manner that ensures there even is a largely free and fair election in 2028 to hold an open primary for.

And in the mind\'s of any Americans that thinks the world revolves around America.\n\nHere\'s an ariticle in Russian that goes into great detail about Putin\'s decision to invade Ukraine.\n\n[https://verstka.media/kak-putin-pridumal-voynu](https://verstka.media/kak-putin-pridumal-voynu)\n\nI\'ll quote the parts I think are most relevant:\n\nThis is a long quote. So, a short summary is that Putin lost major influence over the Ukranian population when Zelensky closed down 3 pro-Russia propaganda TV networks run by pro-Russia ally Viktor  Medvedchuk.  And that was the deciding factor to invade Ukraine.  The parts of the article I did not quote go into more detail about Putin\'s other reasons.  None of them have to do with Trump or Biden being president. Although it does have to do with Ukraine\'s gradual movement towards democracy and western culture.\n\n>Three sources in the Russian president\'s entourage confirmed that it was this story of the destruction of \\[pro-Russia media mogul\\] Medvedchuk\'s information resource and the fact that they began to ""harass"" him that became the last straw in Putin\'s decision to prepare for a military operation. The Kremlin decided not to resort to ""soft power"" instruments any more.\n\n>""\xa0The attack, when they took away his television \\[networks\\] and started to beat up the party, really got Putin really worked up,"" says one of the Russian president\'s old acquaintances. ""He took it as a personal attack\xa0. The existence of Medvedchuk and his channels was like a bridge and a hope to somehow resolve the situation by political methods. And suddenly Ukraine escalated. Oh, you decided to escalate? Didn\'t you understand who you were dealing with?""\n\n>Putin\'s decision was also influenced by Medvedchuk himself, who regularly told the Russian president about the great support for him personally and the pro-Russian sentiments in Ukraine. ""He told fairy tales, mastered the money that he was paid for organizing political resistance, and did not believe that anyone would ever check,"" recalls a source close to the presidential administration. ""He talked about the loyalty of the territory, stupidly misleading Putin.""\n\n>The Kremlin did not question Medvedchuk\'s words. ""Instead of drawing conclusions about the adequacy of the information received, analyzing and seeing the obvious picture that they were not welcome here, resentment and anger clouded their eyes,"" Ukrainian political adviser Kharebin shrugged. However, Medvedchuk could not have imagined that Putin would use his data to decide on a light special operation aimed at a quick change of power in Kyiv, says a source familiar with him. Putin seriously counted on the support of the population throughout the country, which his trusted godfather told him about. ""For Medvedchuk, the decision to go to war turned out to be the most catastrophic scenario,"" says a person close to Putin.\n\n>When making the decision to go to war, Putin did not consult with Medvedchuk. Nor with anyone else. The only person who had constant access to Putin was his friend Yuri Kovalchuk*i*.\xa0Two sources confirm that Kovalchuk played a decisive role in the president\'s decision to carry out a special operation. During the pandemic, only Yuri Kovalchuk did not leave Putin\'s residence to avoid quarantine\xa0. Kovalchuk has never hidden his anti-Western sentiments, and it was perhaps he who got Putin interested in the writers the president began studying in the second decade of the 2000s. Since March 2020, they have spent hours talking about the conflict with the West and Russian history, The Wall Street Journal wrote. This is also confirmed by sources interviewed by Verstka: “At that time, Putin was limited in communicating with adequate people. He tried not to meet with anyone, and if he did, during the 14 days of quarantine, people became so enraged that a normal conversation did not take place. In addition, a meeting at a distance of 15 meters does not imply confidential communication.”', 2], ['It does not use the word democracy, but it clearly sets up a democracy with power reserves to its citizens in the first line of the Preamble.

I suppose you can argue that gerrymandering either fixes or exacerbates that.\n\nObviously the electoral college sets up a really strange variety of republic/democracy variations, depending on each state and how they cast their ballots.\n\nBut to go back to the original point, the Preamble sets up the country as a democracy by clarifying rule by ""the People"" and even inserts that language into the legislative articles.\n\nBut also, yes, we have representatives to set guard rails.

Even if Biden dropped dead the second after he is sworn in again, a White House and Congress in the hands of the Democrats is a must. Anything else will have disastrous consequences. If you’re serious about saving American democracy, you’ll vote blue no matter what. A vote for anyone else is a vote for Trump. \n\nYou know that Trump *will* end up ending American democracy if he gets reelected. You know that whomever the Democrats end up putting on that ballot is the *only* person who has any shot at beating Trump from that point onwards, even if those chances are potentially minuscule. If the Democrats change their nominee, vote for the new nominee. If Democrats still send Biden, be angry about it but vote for him regardless. Vote blue down the ballot as well. \n\nI say this as a German whose great great grandpa was a Social Democrat in the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany. He was arrested and imprisoned three times under the Nazis. The first time was in the night from 9th to 10th March 1933, when the nazis on the “legal” basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree arrested Social Democratic, Communist, Socialist and other oppositional leading members of the Reichstag, in order to keep them from voting against the Enabling Act in the parliamentary vote on 23rd March 1933. \n\nThe Nazis held him at Dachau twice, once from late April to early May 1933, and then again from late August 1944 to the end. He died days after being liberated in May 1945 as a direct consequence of what the Nazis did to him. \n\nThey outlawed the freaking SPD, the Social Democratic Party as a terrorist organisation. For those who don’t know, the SPD is currently one of the ruling parties in Germany and obviously not a terrorist threat, nor were they one back then. They sentenced my great great grandfather to two and a half years in prison for possessing and distributing social democratic leaflets and magazines. \n\nYou Americans, you are currently in 1932, only the situation is a little more drastic. The Supreme Court already passed the Enabling Act for you. It took the Nazis until 24th March 1933 to sign it into law. If someone who will make use of it gets elected to the White House, you’re done. That’s it. Trump is that guy, both he and the Republican Party have been very open about that. \n\nYou get one shot at this. No matter how unable to function Biden seems, his staff and his VP and he himself in his limited capacities will at the very least protect your democracy to the best of their abilities. So knowing that whoever ends up being the Democratic nominee is the *only* person with any sort of chance to preserve your democracy, vote for whomever they end up nominating. If it’s someone new, cool. If it isn’t, it really doesn’t matter. Vote blue this time in order to get a choice next time. Biden can’t run in 2028. You *will* have an open primary for the 2028 election.

Which is why most black people prefer moderate Democrats and aren\'t that fond of progressives. 19% of black men voted Trump, 9% of black women.

Obviously, because you are wrong when we talk in reality, with proper perspective.\xa0\n\n\nThe fact you say the bettering markets don't matter shows you're the one who failed stats. It's proven that they are more accurate than poll markets. Btw In just checked and Biden has a 17% chance of winning right now vs Trump's 56%. If that doesn't bother you, then I don't talk to people of your mental capacity.\xa0\n\n\nI also am probably not voting Trump.

This all should have come to light debating his own party, not 4 months before the election against someone the party has no business losing to.\xa0\n\n\nDNC = Do Nothing Correctly. Enjoy supporting a party that doesn't care about the process of democracy and only wants to pick their candidates for their masses. The track record is clear.\xa0\n\n\nBernie wasn't allowed to run because he is anti establishment, so super-delegates ended his run in primaries, despite what the people wanted. Next cycle, Biden won fair and square. But then this garbage of no primary for someone who should have been forced to have one because he had to prove he was still fit to lead another 4 years.\xa0\n\n\nSo 2 out of 3 election cycles is just blatantly ignore the democratic process. Great leadership and totally screwing America in the process.\xa0 Love or hate Trump, he's the candidate GOP voters picked. If GOP had Super delegates, they would have used them to block Trump. But they don't, because that makes no sense that one person's votes are worth more than another. Last time we saw that was the 3/5th compromise. That would make you a lesser person from your elite party leaders perspective.
