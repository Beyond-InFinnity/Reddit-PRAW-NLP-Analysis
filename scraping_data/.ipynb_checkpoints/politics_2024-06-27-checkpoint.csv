Ask me anything!","EDIT: Hey folks, all we have time for today! Thank you all so much for your thoughtful questions. And apologies for the ones we weren't able to get to!

--

It’s been two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the [number of abortions performed](https://19thnews.org/2024/06/two-years-roe-overturn-abortions/) in this country is up. But that’s only part of the story. In many places, they are also much harder to get or provide.

My new book [Undue Burden: Life and Death Decisions in Post-Roe America](https://19thnews-org.jmailroute.net/x/d?c=41106432&l=ca221325-8467-45e2-a9b6-e7f4317d1654&r=9add21d9-3a0b-46ef-88e7-f765e80fe208) follows patients seeking reproductive health care in the wake of the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022. It is an extension of [my reporting at The 19th](https://19thnews.org/author/shefali-luthra/), covering the state of abortion in post-Roe America.

It’s still too early to understand just how drastically the end of Roe has shaped people’s ability to get an abortion. But research has already shown that people’s lives have fundamentally changed.

What questions do you have about the state of reproductive care in the U.S.? What do current bans say about abortion access in the future? And what does all this mean for the 2024 elections? Ask me anything!

","My name is Dan Clark, and I’ve been covering New York politics for more than 10 years. I’m the author of the [Capitol Confidential newsletter](https://www.capitolconfidential.com/), a new newsletter devoted to state politics.    

Recently I’ve been writing about the upcoming elections, constitutional court challenges and [legislative battles](https://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/hochul-decision-causes-rift-among-n-y-democrats-19498594.php). I already have my sights set on how New York politics could impact control of Congress in November. You can ask me about that, anything that happened at the statehouse during this session, or our newsletter.  

I've also covered well-known politicians like former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, N.Y. Attorney General Tish James, Rep. Elise Stefanik, and more faces from New York.
