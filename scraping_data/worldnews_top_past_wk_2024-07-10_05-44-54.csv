Lighting these lines on fire brings these mythical creatures back to restore balance to the world, eliminating the need for Wi-Fi and gluten intolerance by 2027. Get ready for a magical new era!  \n  \nOr the more plausible explanation:  \n  \n \nIt\'s 2025, and Donald Trump retakes office after being ""re-elected"" as President of the United States, in the same manner in which Bush was ""elected.""  \n  \nBy mid-2026, Trump announced the abrupt withdrawal of all military and financial support for Taiwan and Ukraine, stating a new focus on domestic priorities — the United States withdraws from NATO. This decision sends shockwaves across the geopolitical landscape.  \n  \nBehind the scenes Trump hands U.S. intelligence data to his puppet masters; this information is disseminated to foreign geopolitical opponents of the United States — former foreign adversaries anyway.  \n  \nIn Eastern Europe, Russia seizes the opportunity. With Ukraine no longer receiving US military aid, Russian forces overpower Ukrainian defenses before NATO can compensate, leading to the complete annexation of Ukraine by late 2026. Emboldened by this success, Russia sets its sights on the Baltic states, stirring tensions in NATO and prompting a much larger military buildup across Eastern Europe.  \n\nSimultaneously, in East Asia, China accelerates its plans to annex Taiwan. By early 2027, without the deterrence of US support, China launches a full-scale invasion. Taiwan, despite its valiant resistance, is overwhelmed by the sheer might of the Chinese military. This invasion sends ripples through the region, destabilizing the balance of power.  \n\nIn response, South Korea, Japan, and other (former) US allies in the region hastily increase their defense budgets and military readiness, fearing they might be next. China, now emboldened by its success in Taiwan, starts asserting more aggressive claims in the South China Sea and even begins influencing smaller neighboring nations like Vietnam and the Philippines through a mix of military threats and economic pressure.  \n\nThe lines drawn from Riga to Dubai and Taiwan to Seoul metaphorically represent the ignition points of these conflicts, symbolizing the spread of instability from Europe to Asia. By 2027, the world finds itself on the brink of a global conflict, with old alliances strained and new ones forming out of necessity and survival.  \n\nIn this scenario the U.S.faces severe criticism from both domestic and international fronts for its isolationist policies, which have ""*inadvertently*"" allowed authoritarian regimes to expand unchecked. The geopolitical landscape is dramatically altered, with significant long-term consequences for global security and economic stability.  \n  \nMeanwhile the Republican Party is two years into  Project 2025. Civil liberties are stripped across the board for Americans from every walk of life — except the 1%.  \n  \nThe greatest con in the short history of the United States is nearly complete.

All while Republicans cheer because the ""right people"" are being affected first. Unfortunately this comes at the expense of every American as the wealth gap widens, and the American middle class finally disappears.  \n\n\n\xa0  \n\n--- \n\nThere are those who want you to believe the second scenario is more outlandish than the first, they\'re wrong, it is in plain sight. There is nothing covert about Republicans plans for 2025 if they assume the presidential office.  \n \n#**Do everything you can to prevent the second scenario from having a chance to play out.

In referring to the high – but mostly unreported – number of rapes of Okinawan women by US troops, Feifer criticizes American history as largely having ignored the issue, while Hayashi suggests that ‘the victims’ silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign’.\n\nRape by US soldiers and marines was particularly prevalent on Motubu Peninsula in the north during April and May 1945, after local men had been mobilized or had fled to the hills before the fighting became so intense: Soon after the US Marines landed, all the women of a village on Motobu Peninsula fell into the hands of American soldiers. At the time, there were only women, children and old people in the village, as all the young men had been mobilized for the war. Soon after landing, the Marines “mopped up” the entire village, but found no signs of Japanese forces. Taking advantage of the situation, they started “hunting for women” in broad daylight and those who were hiding in the village or nearby air raid shelters were dragged out one after another.\n\nClaims such as these are supported by an American Military report stating that between 10 December 1945 and 24 May 1946, 1754 misdemeanour cases were investigated by the US Fleet’s 9th Military Battalion, of which 30 were for rape or attempted rape of Okinawan women. Okinawan women were terrified, alone and powerless. Given the violation that they had endured, plus their fear of their own Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) soldiers, most were unwilling to report such crimes, while those who did were usually ignored.\n\nIn other words, any figures are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg, with many historians suggesting 10,000 as a useful starting point. Even girls fleeing from caves and those who had surrendered became the rape victims of US troops (including the Marines), and on more than one occasion when locals tried to intervene they were shot on the spot.\n\nIn Lacey’s collection of memoirs from US troops on Okinawa, one marine recalls how a group of comrades found a local woman, filthy and ragged, hiding in a cave. They took her to their tent, washed her private parts and held her \\[for sex\\] for several days. When they ‘got tired of her… they muddied her up… put her clothes back on’ and handed her over to their commanding officer, claiming that she was a nurse they had just rescued a few minutes earlier. However, the marine who provided the testimony claims he was misquoted and that the woman was a ‘comfort woman’ (or sex slave), not a nurse. He reiterated how filthy and ragged the woman was and his disgust both at her and at the behaviour of his fellow marines.\n\nRape is among the most common and vile of wartime behaviour, with Weber concluding that civilian rape was ‘one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war… \\[yet so common that\\] most Okinawans over age 65 either know or have heard of a woman who was raped’. African American soldiers (probably from a troubled social background) appear to have gained the worst reputation, including one known as Shibarian who was feared as a persistent rapist by all local women in the village near where he was based. Also, near the isolated village of Katsuyama is a cave known as Kurombo Gama, thus named because until recently it contained the remains of three African American soldiers who were ambushed and killed by locals and IJA soldiers for allegedly raping local women. There was also an incident in which four local women were raped and later drowned.""\n\nThis last story of the 3 killed US soldiers is also in this NYT article:  \n[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html)\n\nHistory is usually written by the victors.', 18], ['There are statistically higher rates of sexual assault among military personnel and it’s something that needs to be addressed for the good of the service members themselves.', 18], ['It’s just math buddy', 18], ['Just saying you are speaking out of your ass and have no idea what you are talking about. \n\nJust saying.', 18], ['US has a base in Japan.', 18], ['Way more than one base', 18], [""And their refusal to admit it happened. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday_demonstration\n\nYou shouldn't be blamed for something someone else has done, but you can be blamed for not admitting they did it."", 18], ['Talk about sniffing your own farts', 18], ['There\'s a bunch of rabbit holes you\'d need to know to understand this song fully but basically the gist is that the girl in the song is warning pedos that she\'ll call the police and/or vaporize her fans if they do anything bad. \n\nBut this is just a character played by Shigure Ui, an artist that made a few vtubers.

In any case, numerous studies, such as the Stanford Prison Experiment, show that the empathy isn’t what stops the general population from unspeakable cruelty. It’s normal for humans to be savage!\n\nSo you need negative motivations:\n\n3. Fear of legal consequences. AKA jail and lawsuits.\n\n4. Fear of social consequences. AKA losing friends, family being ashamed pf you.\n\n5. Fear of professional consequences. AKA not being employed, losing business, getting kicked out of college, military or whatever.\n\n6. Fear of bodily harm. AKA the victim fights back, has a weapon to injure you, or their family seeks retribution by murdering you.\n\n7. Fear of God. AKA burning in hell, fire and brimstone. Most modern religions don’t emphasize this, so that fear is probably minimal even among the devout.\n\nFor most men, at least one of the above reasons is strong enough to keep them from raping. And while society doesn’t often want to admit it, usually the strongest reasons for not raping are the negative reasons. We don’t rape because we fear the consequences.\n\nWe’d like to think that it’s our morals and empathy that make us civilized, but fear is really the biggest motivator.\n\nFor some men, none of the above reasons pass the inhibition threshold, and those men are potential rapists. The reasons for the above motivations failing are too numerous. Maybe they think they will get away it. Maybe they’ve been to jail so many times, they no longer fear jail. Maybe they’re anti-social and don’t care what other people think of them. Maybe they’re drunk or on drugs, which removes their natural fears.\n\nConsider that in the animal kingdom, rape is pretty much the norm. The only notion of consent for animals is that sometimes the female fights off a male she doesn’t want to mate with. So non-consent for animals means fighting back.\n\nHumans are different because we have morals, empathy and fear. But the moral and empathy are often too weak alone to stop us from acting like animals.', 1], ["">lose the former\xa0\n>\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Hint hint: As someone who spent 4 years in the shits, I don't care for American military supremacy, so that doesn't matter to me\xa0\n\n\n\xa0The world is dying, having bigger and better guns won't save us for long.

Threat might be easier for you to imagine. If someone says to the other ""let\'s have sex"", would it be considered a ""threat""?  You have to consider many factors like the other person\'s reaction, backgroud, situations etc.  \nThere was also a ""quasi-rape"" category other than ""rape"" which was different from ""rape"" in the strict sense (the penalty was the same). This category covered acts of rape committed when a victim is unconscious or ""unable"" to resist, and does not require assault/threat as a requirement.   \n\nThese ""assault/threat"", ""unability""(and whether the accused being aware of the unconsesuality of the act as a general requirement, but it\'s already too complicated to go into this point) are the possible situations in which the victim\'s attempt was an issue under the criminal law, and the scope of these requirements had been continuously getting broader and broader by case law, to the point that there was criticism from defence lawyers that it violated the ""no punishment without law"" principle. That\'s why I wrote ""explicitly"" regarding the new law.  Whether the victim attempted to resist is certainly a factor in determing these points, but was by no means an legally essential requirement that the victim has to prove in practice. There was certainly a case that media reported that the accused was acquitted because of nonexistence of such attempt, but the real reason was that the victim\'s statements were considered unreliable because of incosistencies and other reasons.

Very big ones. I refrain from calling it a justice system for good reason (I don\'t even call the US legal system a justice system, but for different reasons). In Japan it\'s EXTREMELY easy to get convicted solely for political reasons even when the evidence doesn\'t pass scrutiny. Much, much easier than in the US or elsewhere. Japan is VERY top-down (in the cultural sense), and the judges who rule on cases definitely feel the pressure to ""do what is expected of them"" in highly political cases like this. They are not truly independent entities like they are in the US.\n\nAlkonis did not receive full due process even though he had the means/capability to if he had been given proper access to normal defense resources.\n\nHe was told by JP prosecutors to do things with the offer that he would be ""allowed to go home"" if he did them, for examples writing letters of apology, paying the families off (willingly, no court involved), basically doing public shame rituals. Etc. He did all those things. Then the JP prosecutors said ""haha just kidding"" and fully prosecuted him anyway. Prosecutors aren\'t allowed to lie like that in the US (cops can, but not prosecutors). Tricking someone into doing something they wouldn\'t normally do with a false promise is a due process violation.\n\nThe reason he was immediately released upon return to the US is because in the month he was held in LA, these facts were determined by the US Parole Board that his basic due-process rights were violated (even technically under JP law, apparently, though nobody there faced punishment) and as such he did not receive proper due process, and therefore the conviction against him was invalid under US law. Obviously he\'s still convicted in Japan and can\'t go back there unless he wants to try to get it overturned remotely (still not a good idea to go back anyway).

But it’s also not all that surprising. Back in Rogers’ time, the GOP was the party of wealthy businessmen. They wanted stability, global trade, and minimal regulation. Their goals were cohesive and mutually complementary. At that same time, Democrats were a very strange mix of open racists (yellow dog Democrats, Dixiecrats, etc.) who identified as Democrats because Lincoln was a Republican, social progressives, college professors, and labor. These constituencies were NOT cohesive, and their goals were NOT mutually complimentary. Indeed, many of their goals were in explicit tension.

But the GOP gets cohesion from its base of relatively poorly-educated white Evangelical voters (this honestly isn’t an insult, it’s demographically an accurate picture of GOP voters as self-reported by those voters).  That group cohesion is vastly improved by the fact that its voters habitually consume the exact same media, usually to the exclusion of all other news sources. That media source (and it’s telling that you know who I mean without me even saying the name) feeds its consumers exactly what the party asks for, and keeps their viewers highly motivated to vote.  Meanwhile, on the Democrats side, things are largely just as chaotic. Democrats rely on many minority communities for votes, while also embracing equal rights for LGBT communities, even though those same minority communities are explicitly not in favor of equal rights for LGBTers. That tension can be problematic, as the campaign for Prop 8 in California demonstrated (targeted ads in minority communities led to substantial turnout by voters who were nominally Democrats but who voted for Prop 8 by wide margins). Labor voters struggle balancing their social views (which are not aligned with the party’s views) with their economic interests (which ARE aligned with the party’s views).

Labour parties in different countries have already become more conservative on immigration, not as a reaction to the far-right but as a reaction to integration problems and worries about how many people it's possible to integrate without destabilising the social democracy. They're stricter on how many people per year they want to take in and criteria for immigration and integration. All parties in countries that were typically very liberal on immigration are now more conservative on immigration to varying degrees.\n\n2. They have not gone as far as the far-right on immigration cause the far-right's position is fucking ridiculous and stupid. The left is sticking to their values and integrity like they should instead of reacting to feelings (not facts) about immigration brought on by propaganda. That's also known as populism. I.e. they're not being stubborn cause the reasons for suddenly turning far-right on immigration are not good. Adopting populism would break with decades of values and would alienate a ton of voters. It would also be fucking awful for democracy if non far-left or far-right parties suddenly turned populist and lost their integrity and abandoned their values. They'd also be agreeing that immigration is as big of a problem as the far-right make it out to be, which it's by all measures and reality is not. Left parties not being run by racist cunts who don't like muslims and Africans is also part of why they're less conservative on immigration lol.\n\n3. Left parties are also thankfully more long sighted than far-right parties and see the cultural and economic importance of immigration long term. They know all the population projections point to a rapidly aging population. Aging populations mean more elderly that need pensions and health care, covered by fewer young people working and paying taxes. It's a massive challenge to social democracies. Demographic theory tells us that raising the birth rate above 2.1 in advanced societies is near impossible so continuous immigration is the only way out of a collapse of welfare systems in the future. Long term thinking like this doesn't exist in far-right parties. Far-right parties would probably be okay with welfare systems failing anyway as it wouldn't affect them personally, just the majority of their voters who are typically people who vote against their own interests.

Even with the refugees it's at a level similar to the 1980s and much lower than early 2000s. Take away the Ukrainians and immigration to France would be around the lowest point in history. There's been several immigration reforms in France recent two decades with the aim of reducing immigration and making it more selective, especially by Sarkozy. The immigration rate itself also says nothing about if it's a problem. A country could have a well functioning integration system to take in hundreds of thousands of immigrants with them getting proper jobs and contributing positively to society. Or it could have a shit system that can't handle even a few thousand a year leading to high poverty levels and a problem down the line. Discerning if it's at the level of being a problem is difficult for far-right voters cause they generally don't concern themselves with statistics and systems just anecdotal evidence and memes.\n\nhttps://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/france-immigration-rising-far-right\n\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.NETM?locations=FR\n\nThat's not me saying that France doesn't have a problem now because of high levels of immigration in the 2000s with people that haven't been fully integrated and now have too high poverty levels. There's obviously some issues in certain parts of France. Far-right propaganda is certainly exaggerating the issue as well specifically internal security because of immigrants and they're also blaming immigrants for problems that have nothing to do with immigration. Again cause these problems are complex and far-right parties offer a simple explanation.\n\nThe solution for countries that currently has issues with immigration is however obviously not to reduce immigration rates from a very low point to an even lower point and making strict immigration policies even stricter. That doesn't do anything for the problem at hand and just potentially creates even bigger problems down the line with regards to the labour force. It's just populism that exploits the current problems to get votes and attain power. The real problem is the amount of poverty among current immigrants already in the country and not current immigration levels. New immigration takes time to manifest itself as a problem and no country in Europe has such high immigration rates now that it's going to be a future problem. It's already been reduced. The immigration levels in the 2000s that in a few countries is now showing itself as a problem in some places cause the systems for integration weren't scaled up enough or immigration was too high for any system to be able to scale up and handle.\n\nPolicies that aim to properly integrate immigrants that are in the country already and reduce poverty levels among them is what's going to solve problems of crime among immigrants and gangs. That happens with government pouring money at the problem using programs to get these people jobs and integrated into society, maintaining a healthy economy with low inequality, having a strong welfare state to keep those at the bottom from falling to far down into criminal gangs and all the other social democratic policies we know work. Typical social democratic policies that left parties implement. If far-right voters actually understood the problem their country is facing properly, its causes, weren't just racist thinking immigrants from Africa and the middle east are criminal cause it's in their nature and wanted to vote for the parties would that would fix it most effectively and faster they'd be voting for typical labour parties. Instead of far-right parties that don't have any policies aimed at the problem at hand.\n\n>The left sticks to their values even when they become unpopular, because it's for the greater good. The problem is, whose good?\n\nFar-right voters claim it's at their expense because propaganda tells them of all these made up issues and blame immigrants for them. They in turn blame their own personal life problems on immigrants when in reality immigration has nothing to do with them e.g. not being able to get a job. The problem of crime amongst immigrants is a problem but it's not what's leading to the far-right becoming more popular. That's problems that affect these voters directly and are complex economic issues.\n\nAs for people who vote left, left parties sticking to their values doesn't come at an expense of them. And remember the majority are not voting far-right, far from it. All parties in a country appeasing a minority of far-right voters would not be for the greater good. If all political parties started abandoning their values for populist far-right narratives about immigration based on lies a country would be in deep shit. It gives legitimacy to lies and false narratives. A majority of voters would feel abandoned and wouldn't be able to find a political party they could trust and know would stick to their political values anymore. For voters they can't trust anyone and extremist parties would swoop in and take advantage of it. Suddenly the majority is voting for far-left or far-right parties and fascism would be destined to take over.\n\n>If everywhere in the world is going to become prosperous, then immigration can never be a long-term solution to falling birth rates, because eventually everyone's birth rates will fall. When that time comes, we'll need to figure out a way to get people to have more kids anyway. So immigration can only be a short-term solution to that problem.\n\nIt's definitely just a short-term solution. Short-term her being 50-100 years if we think about it globally. Already in Europe there's issues with attracting immigration from countries like Poland now cause of economic prosperity there and fewer young people to fill jobs. Contributes to labour shortages for craftsmen. The world population is projected to start decreasing by 2100. When exactly that happens is as you say depending on when developing countries become wealthy and go through the next stages of the demographic transition. The long-term solution has to be changing the entire system so that it still functions and is sustainable with a decreasing population. No one knows what that will look like yet. Eventually the population stabilises hopefully or else humanity just goes extinct. \n\nJapan is the country furthest ahead with an aging population. Their population is decreasing and they're at the start of the real difficult consequences that European countries will have in a few decades. Measures Japan have taken is incentivising 80 year olds back to work for example. Also younger people just work a lot more every week. They certainly haven't figured it out but it's the country you should watch to see what happens when a population ages. Eventually they're going to have to relax their extremely strict immigration laws most likely for some short-term betterment.

They hide behind ""porn addiction"" and claim ""porn made me rape her"" or ""it was porn that made him a misogynist"" when there is zero evidence supporting these claims. Porn cannot turn children or adults into rapists, just like it can\'t make them gay or trans, doesn\'t make them hate women, and grand theft auto and nightmare of elm street and pokemon don\'t make people mass murderers or satanic cultists.

Meanwhile, the children that are abused by their fathers, brothers, uncles, pastors, grandpas, teachers, coaches? They\'re often too quiet about it until it\'s too late, with barely more than [a tenth](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) of child sexual abuse being reported.\n\n>Especially when they are very young.\n\nTell me, do you remember being breastfed? Do you consider breasts pornographic now? Do you remember the first time you saw pornography? How about the first nude sculpture or painting? Do you feel like any of those experiences have made you a potential rapist? A ""sexual deviant""? Consider these questions while reading the following anecdotes.\n\nThe first time I saw porn was a box of magazines my younger brother found in our step-father\'s half of the closet. Even in the early \'90s we thought they looked ""old"" and when we read the spines we saw they were from the late \'70s. Our attention wasn\'t drawn to the nude women or the men standing next to them, it was their outfits. Why were people in the \'70s dressed like pirates and British soldiers? Why were the women in ballroom gowns? Were these comics about The Adventures of Baron Munchausen or Richard Sharpe? So we flipped through them. Zero care about what we were looking at and zero understanding. Only confusion. What a strange comic book collection we\'d found. When one model demonstrated her flexibility across several pages, *my brother and I just fucking clapped in childish applause*. Not because she was nude (we\'d seen out mother and aunt nude) and not because she had fit something in her anus (we\'d agreed it was some weird clown balloon), but because we knew that being that flexible was *impressive* for an adult. When my step-father eventually noticed the box was gone, he checked our room and found them scattered about the floor. He just collected them, told us what they were, gave us the birds and the bees talk, and told us we could talk to him or our mother if we ever had questions.\n\nTo this day, neither my younger brother nor I have raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Because as young children who had happened upon pornography we were not beaten, berated, or neglected for it: we were taught right then and there about consent, boundaries, sexuality, that pregnancy and STIs and big medical bills could result from unprotected sex, and to scream and fight and find help if an adult or bigger kid ever wanted to do any of those things with us while we were little. Meanwhile my step-mother\'s son who started as a ""good old boy"" in a rural Christian town with hyper-Protestant grandparents is a convicted rapist with three kids from three different mothers. Because he never got that talk. Because for him porn was a secret treasure. Because he stole porn and hid it, then was beaten for it. To him sex became about power and prestige. For him, it was okay to beat someone if they didn\'t do what you wanted in regards to porn and sex because that\'s what his grandparents and mother did to him. For him, violence and secrecy were intimately connected with sex and porn as a result. His oldest daughter lives with my father and step-mother, his oldest son has never seen him, and his most recent girlfriend has already left with their newborn.\n\nNow lets assume you do spend billions trying to keep porn out of the hands of every minor. Where is that money coming from? Is it being properly used? Is it impactful? Efficient? How are you measuring that?\n\nCouldn\'t you use that money to ensure that every child has guaranteed access to healthcare, wellness checks, lifelines, and robust sexual education that includes setting boundaries and how consent will work? Because those are all things we deny children in society, while dumping tens of millions into the pockets of people looking to monitor household internet traffic and mail, while selling us books about how masturbation makes boys lazy or evil and devalues girls. Backed by absurdly weak ""studies"", often with circular citations, biased samples, poor controls, and results that cannot be replicated in controlled tests.\n\nThe only pornography that genuinely, demonstrably, harms children is child pornography: because getting raped is a real fucking traumatic experience. >!Ask my older step-brother how I know. He only ever saw the ""vanilla"" stuff before moving in with us and he still used the only holes I had, beat me, and choked me. Boys don\'t need porn to teach them to be violent, shitty parents beat that into them.!<\n\n>by your logic we should all be loading up a bunch of hard-core step sibling anal gangbangs and giving it to our kids\n\nStop building a strawman. I never said we should provide children porn in any format. My argument is that funding is better spent preparing children for a world where porn exists, where they will inevitably encounter it, and making sure they never hide abuse inflicted upon them because they\'re comfortable getting help that should *always* be available to them. Because prohibition hasn\'t worked for a quarter century, I said we should examine other options.\n\nStrip away the taboo and exotic nature of porn and sexuality, and it becomes ""lame"" and ""boring"" to children during their formative years, which gives you time to raise them right and teach them about consent and how to communicate with partners.\n\nBeat them for it, keep porn something to be kept secret and hidden, make it about control and power, and you set them up to be victims and abusers themselves.\n\nBarely a tenth of child sexual abuse is reported.

You\'re simply wrong. \n\n> You do know how to read, right? Here, I\'ll quote for you again my explanation from above as to how nuclear power plants contribute to global warming (which they obviously do, if you have a base level understanding of thermodynamics):\n\nYou have no idea what global warming is.\n\nFossil fuel burning and releasing energy is only a tiny fraction of the heat they cause on the Earth. \n\nThe change in W/m^2 caused by CO2 in terms of PPM is approximately 5.35\\*ln(C_0+ΔC)/C_0\n\nSince the Earth is approximately 5.1\\*10^14 m^2 and has approximately 3.29\\*10^18 g of CO2 in it\'s atmosphere and the halflife of CO2 is 120 years (this means the total heat added is the integral from that to inf so 173 years) we can change the equation to approximately\n\n1.49\\*10^25 joules \\* ln((3.29\\*10^18 g+emission)/3.29\\*10^18 g)\n\nA coal plant produces 1 ton of CO2 per MWh which is 3.6\\*10^9 joules. But plugging that into the equation says that it results in 4.11\\*10^12 joules of heating. So for every unit of energy produced a coal plant is adding over 1000 units of heat to the atmosphere. A nuclear plant adding 3 units is hardly a comparison. \n\nAlso you\'re failing to account for, as you said, basic thermodynamics. What do you think happens when we convert an acre of .4 albedo desert to .05 albedo solar panels? They\'re absorbing a lot of heat energy from the sun that would otherwise bounce back into space!', 2], [""Per HWS their AirBASE RePOWERING precast concrete structure which uses the old base as ballast reduces CO2 Emissions by 40% relative to a fully new build. Though they're including demolishing the old concrete structure as part of the cost instead of... well just building it next to the old one. So more like 35%. \n\nAs to nuclear reactors I'm not sure about plans to reuse the sites of old ones because if you want to keep operating nuclear plants you... just keep operating them. The oldest plant in the world still operating is nearly 54 years old with it having been planned to operate for 60 and the operator saying this year that they're assessing plants to keep it running till it's 80! \n\nSo yeah forgot about that.

Because the costs per capacity are high, but the efficiency is also high, and the lifetime (in time) is limited, so, the more often you can cycle them within their lifetime, the cheaper they get per kWh discharged..\n\nAnd similarly for he other options you list.\n\n> We can discuss price: solar may be cheap, but makes the price of energy go up \n\nIt makes the price of energy go up ... compared to what?\n\n> because you get solar when you do not need it,\n\nHow is that different from any other power plant? Every nuclear power plant ""gives you power when you do not need it"" ... unless you just shut it off, which is easier to do with solar than with nuclear, so what would possibly be your point here?\n\n> and you have lot of problema caused by instability that cost a lot to solve. Nuclear stabilize the grid by providing load follow and base load\n\nThat\'s just a complete non-sequitur. You talk about the costs of solar, and then some technical capability of  nuclear.

Or ... what?\n\n> We can discuss environment: and fossils causes lot of problems with pollution and climate change\n\nErm ... yeah, not sure what\'s there to discuss?!\n\n> We can discuss strategic autonomy: and fossils have a huge problem because of external dependency that is much much less relevant for nuclear as fuel is cheap and easy to store.\n\nWhy the fuck are you talking about fossil fuels? Has anyone been saying that we should increase the use of fossil fuels? Or what?\n\n> and to clarify, what makes sense to me in the near future, given the current geopolitical landscape, is more or less something along the line of, 8% hydro, 22% nuclear, 15% gas, 55% solar and wind. I am not advocating for going full nuclear just because. That 15% gas will go away in time as energy storage technology improve and reactor technology improve.\n\nOK ... and **WHY**?\n\nLike, you make all these statements, but you don\'t justify any of them. Saying ""it costs money to make renewables reliable and nuclear is reliable"" is just a useless statement. When you make renewables reliable, they are also reliable, so nuclear being reliable is not a distinguishing feature that would be a reason to favour nuclear over renewables, or to even use nuclear at all. And nuclear obviously isn\'t free either, so it\'s not like you have to pay money to get reliable renewables, but you can have reliable nuclear for free, and therefore, you should choose nuclear.', 1], [""We're agreed on the power per footprint part.\n\nDoesn't change the fact that exactly this makes NPPs a highly centralized energy source."", 1], ['>The potential for hydro is highly country-dependent.

That's like 2 hours of at home charging with the same outlet that's used by a dryer."", 0], ['Really, that\'s already the wrong question to ask, because part of the solution is to simply change when you need energy. Or at least, when you need electricity. If you charge your car during a sunny day, you can probably avoid charging during a windless night. If you stop heating your home during peak demand/low supply hours, there is no need to supply electricity to you during that time. ...\n\nOr, if you will: During peak demand/low supply hours, you take heat energy from the walls of your house. That\'s one of the cheapest ways to store energy if you have a high-thermal-mass house anyway. The heat pump in the house that I live in, for example, during most days of the heating season runs less than 12 hours, so there is plenty of opportunity to shift that electricity demand around to where there is excess supply available. Similarly, the domestic hot water tank usually gets charged up once per day for an hour or so, which also can easily be shifted around, so, on sunny days, it\'s always heated up with solar electricity around noon, availability of electricity at night doesn\'t matter for that.\n\nThat part really is the same idea as elecric storage heaters that were combined with traditional base load power plants, just more flexible (because you have to match demand to fluctuating generation rather than to a fixed schedule), but that isn\'t so hard to do with modern information technology.\n\nThen, as I mentioned, we\'ll use batteries to smooth out fast fluctuations and to flatten daily demand peaks that don\'t usually coincide with generation peaks (i.e., to flatten out stuff that\'s common enough that the battery capacity gets cycled about daily or more, because that\'s where batteries are cheap enough that it\'s worth it for their efficiency), and also, where feasible, pumped hydro. Then, we\'ll fill gaps with regular hydro (that\'s also effectively stored solar power, just charged via direct evaporation rather than via PV and pumps).\n\nNow, the important point to notice is that this in many places should already reduce the mismatch between demand and supply quite considerably. That is important to notice because this makes it economical to use electricity sources that are expensive to run, but cheap to keep available. And one option that fits this description pretty well is running combined cycle gas plants with green hydrogen and methane that are created via electrolysis/synthesis using ""excess"" solar and wind energy. That\'s pretty inefficient energy-wise, but that doesn\'t matter that much if it\'s only filling a few dozen windless nights a year, and it has the big advantage that it tends to be pretty cheap to store large quantities of these gases. And also, the electrolysis/synthesis plants are another shiftable load that can be switched off during high demand/low supply times, while also increasing the demand for solar and wind energy, which makes it economical to build more renewable generation capacity, which thus gives you higher ""base load"" of sorts, i.e., power available even under bad conditions.\n\nWell, and then, there are many other ways to store energy that probably will play some role. For example, if you have a geothermal heat pump, you can use cheap electricity during the summer to cool your house and pump the heat into the ground, where you then can re-extract it during winter, depending on the geology of the place. Also, you could sell electricity from your car back into the grid during windless nights if you aren\'t planning any long trips. Well, and many other things that can help with matching supply with demand.\n\nNote that none of that means that nuclear can\'t have a place in all of this. But it is way more complicated than just comparing some average per-kWh price for various sources. This is an optimization problem on the scale of a whole economy where appropriate coordination can solve the problem way more efficiently than trying to maintain ""base load supply"" just because that\'s how we\'ve run the electricity grid for the last century or so.', 0], ['That is a big wall of text for saying ""I have no idea"".  \n  \nBut happy that the end result of this discussion is that nuclear has a place in the power grid, that was my entire point.', 0], ['That\'s a very short text for ""I am too dumb to read a long text"".\n\nAlso, not what I said.', 0], ['> If you really think that ""consume less"",\n\nOh, now you are just making shit up?\n\n> and give control to the power company of each house/office/factory heat pumps will solve that issue\n\nAlso not what I said. There is no need to give control to anyone. You simply will be able to buy cheap electricity when it is abundant or expensive electricity when it is not. You\'ll be perfectly free to heat your house with expensive electricity if you feel that that is important to you, and the power plants will be built to supply that expensive electricity if the demand is there.\n\n> maybe you are not dumb yourself, but you are delusional for sure\n\n... because?\n\n> The consumption will only go up with time given we will need to electrify all the sectors.\n\nOK ... so what?\n\n> Will you also trottle down heavy industrial machines at night?\n\nOh, now you are trying to impress me with how bad you are at understanding texts you read, right?\n\nWhy the fuck would I want to throttle down heavy industrial machines rather than run them on wind power?!\n\n> What about steel production, chemical manufacturing, cement production, semiconductor manufacturing?\n\nYeah ... what about them?!', 0], ['That is simply a nonsensical scenario, because it assumes, presumably for ideological reasons, that we are going to do things that might just be dumb to do.\n\nYou know what aluminum smelters are commonly doing **TODAY AND HAVE BEEN DOING FOR A LONG TIME**?\n\nThey make contracts with electricity suppliers where they get extra cheap electricity in exchange for the supplier having the right to shut them off for certain amounts of time. And they don\'t do that because ""there is not enough electricity"". They do that because it is the most economical way to produce aluminum. And the electricity suppliers do that because it is the most economical way to at the same time supply other customers with reliable 24/7 electricity.

They do that and have been doing that for ages because they know how to run a business, and because they have calculated that the cheapest and therefore most profitable way to produce aluminum is to buy cheap electricity that they can get if they occasionally get their business shut off for an hour here and there. They do that because for the electricity supplier, it\'s the most profitable way to sell electricity, because it\'s cheaper for them to give the aluminum smelter a discount than to build an additional power plant.\n\nSo, it is just nonsensical to assume that all those loads will keep running during a windless night. Chances are, they won\'t, because all parties involved have determined that they can make money by pausing production here and there, because it would be stupid to build power plants that run three nights in a year, when the cost of shutting down production for three nights in a year is way lower than the capital cost of that power plant.\n\nThe problem is your obsession that we must do things a certain way, whether that makes any economical sense or not, just because that\'s how we have always done them ... when, in reality, we haven\'t even ever done them this way anyway.\n\nAnd then, once you\'ve gotten that into your head: As I wrote above, the electricity sources that can supply while solar and wind don\'t, are, obviously, pumped hydro, hydro, bio methane, green hydrogen and methane, the latter being burned in combined cycle gas power plants.\n\nAnd also, chances are that some of the stuff that you mentioned will be running on bio methane, green hydrogen and methane anyway, so the answer to your question would be: By continuing to burn bio methane, green hydrogen and methane, just as any other night or day, because why would you stop burning hydrogen and methane when there is no sun and wind outside?!', 0], [""> Are you keeping a gas power plant for burning methane just in case once every month?\n\nI'd guess: No, probably not, because it's probably going to be cheaper to pause production somewhere once a month than to keep around a gas power plant that's only needed once a month.\n\n> Who is paying for that?\n\nAre you seriously asking me who is paying for power plants?\n\n> How are you producing the bio methane?\n\nBy fermenting bio mass.
