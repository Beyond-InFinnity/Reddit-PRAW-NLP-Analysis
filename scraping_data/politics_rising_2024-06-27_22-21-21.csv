He brought a real rifle too, the nail gun was because he thought (wrongly) it could go through bullet-proof glass. \n\n>The attack unfolded after Shiffer repeatedly posted on Truth Social, saying things like “We see the courts are unfair and unconstitutional, all that is left is force” and “patriots are heading to Palm Beach (where Mar A Lago is). I recommend going and being Florida, I think the feds won’t break it up. IF they do, kill them,” attached exhibits said.\n\n>Ricky Shiffer’s Truth Social posts\n\nYou know Chairman Mao said ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."", sounds like MAGA is taking it to heart. Alternatively, that\'s the most American thing a Communist ever said. \n\n>There have been numerous other threats like these, and Trump is on record agreeing that his supporters listen to him like no one else, other exhibits showed.\n\n>While Trump’s defense has maintained that Smith’s bid to modify Trump’s bond conditions is an “unconstitutional” and “shocking display of overreach,” the Special Counsel’s Office has repeatedly urged Cannon to act before someone in law enforcement gets killed.\n\n>“And just last week, a supporter of Trump called an FBI agent associated with the Hunter Biden case and claimed that, if Trump wins reelection, FBI agents will be thrown in jail; and if he does not win, the agents will be ‘hunt[ed] down’ and ‘slaughter[ed]’ in their own homes, after which ‘[w]e’re going to slaughter your whole f—ing family,\'” a June 21 filing from Smith said. “No court would tolerate another defendant deliberately creating such immediate risks to the safety of law enforcement, and this Court should not wait for a tragic event before taking action in this case.”\n\nJudge Cannon might shoot it down, we\'re all expecting her to. But if she does gag Trump, she will likely leave herself unshielded by the order (like Judge Merchan did), which means Trump will have a chance to go after her.

This likely makes the 6 people in the middle all more annoyed... But now those two candidates are the only options. \n\nSecond, the primary system itself essentially precludes anybody running at the middle at all.
