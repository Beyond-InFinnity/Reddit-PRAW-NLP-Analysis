However, in 1792, the first divisions arose when senators split into factions, favoring either federal or state power. This marked the beginning of ongoing political strife. For the past 232 years, this factionalism has driven parties to vie for power. New parties have emerged and disappeared, but the fundamental divide remains:\n\nWho should have more power?\n\n* The states: potentially leading to a fractured nation with 50 separate entities and possibly requiring travel passes to cross state lines.\n* The federal government: potentially resulting in a more dictatorial or Marxist government where citizens have little power.\n\nThere is no simple solution. A new constitution outlining a fresh set of governmental rules and a complete overhaul of America would be required. This is nearly impossible due to the current level of governmental corruption, the influence of the wealthy and corporations, and the complacency of American citizens.\n\nAt our current trajectory, within a few decades, we may see the emergence of a stark class divide.

I want to tell you what I\'m dealing with right now because of this.\n\nSo I live in a very red state. Deep red. I mean a very low on the education scale, high on the gun sales, kind of red state. I\'m SURROUNDED by the lowest information, highest rage group of people you could imagine. I do construction work, so I\'m around these people constantly spouting the most insane things I\'ve ever heard in my life. But there\'s a LOT of them, I\'m out numbered here by a substantial margin. So I try to stay out of their conversation, but at the same time, kind of trying to insert little things here and there, trying to at least spark something in their heads. Often times simply repeating things back to them because, I\'m not sure you hear what you sound like right now.\n\nI\'m sure you could imagine how, the more unhinged trump becomes, the more unhinged they become, right? It\'s getting pretty bad. So, I follow trump on his stupid little, ""truth"" social app which, if you go there looking for ""truth"" you better have brought some with you because THEY don\'t have it there. But, I need to know what the talking points are so I can try to stay ahead of them. And the other day he posted something that I literally just couldn\'t take it anymore, this is unhinged even for trump.\n\nSo apparently Russia has captured an American journalist and is holding him ""prisoner"" for whatever reason. Does he really need a reason, I mean honestly? I was unaware of this but apparently trump is fully aware of this, right? So he comes out, trump, I mean, and posts on his account how this journalist is currently being detained in Russia, how badly he\'s being treated over there and all that, right? He says, and this is a true story, btw, I took a screenshot of this insanity if anyone would like to see it. He says that this journalist, Evan Gershkovich, is his name, his espionage trial is about to start BUT, that trump can and will get him released, on one condition. Guess what that condition is. I bet you\'ll never guess.\n\nIF trump wins the 2024 election. Is that what you guessed? If so, congratulations, you guys have been paying much closer attention than these people were. Trump has LITERALLY come right out and said that, number 1, he has the type of friendship with one of the most horrible people on the planet right now, that he can just call in a favor like that. And number 2, that he has no problem whatsoever, using American lives as pawns in some sick game of his, for personal gain. How am I supposed to interpret it any differently than that? That\'s literally what it is.\n\nSo what, if trump DOESN\'T win the election, Putin can just keep him? Is that what this is? How can you sick, disgusting people STILL grovel at his feet after that? What is it going to take for you people to wake up and join us back on planet earth? Does it have to be YOUR lives he\'s playing with next? If that\'s the case, it would be too late to matter then. I mean, you\'re not under the impression that he just WOULDN\'T do that if it were you, are you? Why wouldn\'t he? He absolutely sure would do it if were you, me, or anyone else because he simply DOES NOT CARE. How much more obvious can he get?\n\nSo, needless to say, I couldn\'t take it anymore and, in the most tactful way I could think of, I brought this to their attention. Surely THIS will at least get them thinking a LITTLE bit, right? If nothing else, they could respect my position on trump now, right?\n\nWrong.

They don\'t pop my tires but they do let the air out of them. ALL of them. Just non stop torment and for what? Because I don\'t worship their trump. It\'s awful, I don\'t even like to think about it but what can I do? I can\'t just move, I\'m not like a wealthy person or anything. The opposite in fact. So I have to just take it. I felt like that at least was a good reason to speak out. Apparently not. Now this is my new life. And when he loses this election, and he will, I honestly don\'t even want to think about what they\'re going to do to me then. Because of course that\'s going to be my fault somehow.\n\nMAGA, please. Please just look at what we\'ve been TRYING to show you, please. And if you don\'t, at least just try to remember we\'re all still technically on the same side, you know?

A lot of rich people don\'t like having their name attached to such a degree.\n\n---\n\nThe main point of Citizens United was whether a corporation (or union) could be restricted, in any capacity, from political expenditures. (A collection of people that engage in independent political spending is a PAC, whether it\'s birthed from a corporation, a union, Joe Schmoe and the Bros, etc.) So corporations and unions could then use their ""general fund"" reserves towards political spending without any limits.\n\nIn the followup case, SpeechNow.org v. FEC, the concern was over how much could be *contributed* to these PACs. If they were supposedly separate from a political candidate, and could spend unlimited amounts of money, then surely they could *receive* unlimited amounts of money from anyone, right? The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that ""because there is no anti-corruption interest in limiting donations to a PAC that is not coordinating with a candidate, the restrictions on individual contributions of this sort violate the first amendment."" This is what finally allowed super PACs to form (independent expenditure-only committees). \n\nThat court\'s reasoning is incredibly important: the court ruled that the first amendment restrictions are illegal *because there is no anti-corruption interest*. That implies that there are some first amendment restrictions that *are* fine, if they are due to anti-corruption interests. **This is true. There *can* be a limit to political speech if there are anti-corruption interests**. This is why you can only donate so much to a candidate or a PAC.\n\n---\n\nSo, are there anti-corruption interests in limiting contributions to PACs that *only* engage in independent expenditures, supposedly separate to the candidate (super PACs)?\n\n- The US supreme court has previously upheld congress\' ability (and the FEC, as a creation and delegation of powers of congress) to limit political contributions where it is avoiding the risk of quid pro quo.\n\n- There is fairly extensive legal evidence that there can be quid pro quo with super PAC contributions. A chief example being USA v. Menendez: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.317102/gov.uscourts.njd.317102.319.0.pdf in which the judge ruled that Citizens United does *not* prevent prosecutions for quid pro quo involving super PAC contributions. (Side note: maybe Menendez getting let off the hook in this case was a huge mistake, given what we know about him now...)\n\n- The quid pro quo mechanism in this case works as such: You have a donor, a super PAC manager, and a political candidate. The manager never talks to the candidate, as that is against the law. The manager fully intends to spend all the money that the super PAC receives to support the candidate or to attack their opponent(s). The donor and the candidate know of this. The donor talks to the candidate and says ""if you do some favor for me, I\'ll donate a million dollars to the super PAC supporting you."" Quid pro quo that is completely legal under SpeechNow.org\'s ruling.\n\n---\n\nThe above is actually core to an effort to reverse Citizens United and SpeechNow.org. It takes those reasons for there being anti-corruption interests in limiting super PACs and applies it as follows:\n\n- The DC court in SpeechNow.org acknowledged that political spending limits can be applied if they are for anti-corruption interests. However, they stated that there are *no* anti-corruption interests in limiting contributions towards what would become super PACs.\n\n- However, the above shows that there is *definitely* the possibility of corruption with super PAC contributions\n\n- Thus, there are anti-corruption interests in limiting contributions to super PACs.\n\nYou can find out more here (Lawrence Lessig is a law professor at Harvard):\n\nhttps://lessig.medium.com/the-argument-that-will-end-superpacs-8d615c1acd95', 1], ['>If Bowman message is so awesome and everybody wants what the DSA is selling the AIPAC ads shouldn\'t matter because the ""revolution"" would drown it out\n\nCool, it\'s funny how Russia can swing an election using memes in 2016 but now messaging has no value.

See 540 U. S., at 204.\n\n>In many ways, then, ¬ß203 functions as a source restriction or a time, place, and manner restriction. It applies in a viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy messages about clearly identified candidates for federal office, made during discrete time periods through discrete channels. In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed to do to broadcast Hillary right before the primary was to abjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC, which by its own account is ‚Äúone of the most active conservative PACs in America,‚Äù Citizens United Political Victory Fund, http://www.cupvf.org/. 40"", 1], [""Frankly, we'd be better off banning than allowing all of it, but allowing a news or media outlet to operate, ideally with some form of fairness doctrine but that's another matter, is a very simple distinction to make versus allowing a Super PAC to spend unlimited funds on advertising.
