The founding fathers endeavored to create a government that allowed states to function as individual entities while maintaining a central government to handle federal matters. They established:\n\n* The House of Representatives to be the voice of the people\n* The Senate to be the voice of the states\n* The President to be the voice of the nation\n\nThey aimed to balance these three branches for equal power and governance. However, in 1792, the first divisions arose when senators split into factions, favoring either federal or state power. This marked the beginning of ongoing political strife. For the past 232 years, this factionalism has driven parties to vie for power. New parties have emerged and disappeared, but the fundamental divide remains:\n\nWho should have more power?\n\n* The states: potentially leading to a fractured nation with 50 separate entities and possibly requiring travel passes to cross state lines.\n* The federal government: potentially resulting in a more dictatorial or Marxist government where citizens have little power.\n\nThere is no simple solution. A new constitution outlining a fresh set of governmental rules and a complete overhaul of America would be required. This is nearly impossible due to the current level of governmental corruption, the influence of the wealthy and corporations, and the complacency of American citizens.\n\nAt our current trajectory, within a few decades, we may see the emergence of a stark class divide.

The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections.”\n> \n> Behind Madison’s statement were the stark facts: The populations in the North and South were approximately equal, but roughly one-third of those living in the South were held in bondage. Because of its considerable, nonvoting slave population, that region would have less clout under a popular-vote system. The ultimate solution was an indirect method of choosing the president, one that could leverage the three-fifths compromise, the Faustian bargain they’d already made to determine how congressional seats would be apportioned. With about 93 percent of the country’s slaves toiling in just five southern states, that region was the undoubted beneficiary of the compromise, increasing the size of the South’s congressional delegation by 42 percent.
