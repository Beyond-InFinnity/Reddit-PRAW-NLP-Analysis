CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated. The debate format allowed CNN to mute candidates’ microphones when it wasn’t their turn to speak.\n\nTrump attacked Biden’s record, blaming inflation and other issues on Biden’s ""insane and stupid policies."" Biden questioned Trump’s conduct, noting that Trump is a convicted felon and saying he has the ""morals of an alley cat.""\n\nBiden and Trump clashed on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their ages. \n\nTrump’s outlandish immigration claim\nTrump says Biden ""allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.""\n\nPants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry.\n\nNot everyone was let in. The term ""noncitizens"" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens.\n\nThe data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it’s inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data’s limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump’s statement.\n\nBiden’s close to the mark about immigration reductions \nBiden: ""I\'ve changed (the law) in the way that now you\'re in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.""\n\nMostly True. The Department of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigration encounters dropped by 40%, to fewer than 2,400 each day, in the weeks after Biden announced a policy largely barring asylum access for people entering the U.S. at the southern border. The policy was announced June 4.\n\nBut immigration experts caution that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. For example, other factors, such as hot weather, can affect migration patterns.\n\nSince the policy was announced only a few weeks ago, it’s unclear whether the drop in illegal immigration will continue. \n\nColleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact the policy could have a short-term deterrent effect. But Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America told PolitiFact, that no crackdown in the past decade has had a lasting impact. \n\nTrump’s falsehoods about his and Biden’s economic achievements\nTrump: ""I gave you the largest tax cut in history.""\n\nFalse. When it was passed in 2017, Trump’s tax cut was, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of gross domestic product, it ranked seventh in history, according to figures published by the Treasury Department.\n\nTrump: ""The only jobs (Biden) created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs, bounce back from the COVID.""\n\nFalse. Since Biden took office in early 2021, the number of foreign-born Americans who are employed has risen by about 5.6 million. But over the same time period, the number of native-born Americans employed has increased by almost 7.4 million. (There are many more native-born Americans than foreign-born Americans, so on a percentage basis, the increase for foreign-born Americans is about 22%, compared with 6% for native-born Americans.)\n\nIt’s also wrong to say that all the foreign-born employment gains (much less all the employment gains, period) stem from migrants here illegally. The data for foreign-born Americans includes anyone born outside the U.S., including immigrants who have been in the United States legally for decades.\n\nEmployment on Biden’s watch passed its prepandemic level by June 2022, about a year-and-a-half into his term. Since then, the U.S. economy has created an additional 6.2 million jobs.\n\nBiden’s economic talking points mostly hit the mark \nBiden: ""Black unemployment is the lowest level it’s been in a long, long time.""\n\nMostly True. The record for low Black unemployment rate was set under Biden in April 2023, at 4.8%. It has risen modestly since then to 6.1% in May 2024, but that’s still lower than it was for much of the first two years under Trump. \n\nOverall, Trump had success on this statistic, too. When Biden set the record, the record he was breaking was Trump’s: 5.3% in August and September 2019.\n\nTrump rewrites history about Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol\nTrump: Pelosi said ""I take full responsibility for Jan. 6.""\n\nFalse. That’s not what former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said.\n\nIn a 41-second video taken on Jan. 6, 2021, Pelosi said, ""I take responsibility for not having them just prepare for more,"" referring to U.S. Capitol security. She did not say she took responsibility for the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nRecords show that Pelosi approved a Jan. 6, 2021, request to seek support from the National Guard and pushed to get National Guard troops to the U.S. Capitol when their deployment was delayed by hours that day.', 11], ['Wow…', 11], ['It’s Joever', 11], ['Biden\'s teams proposed and accepted these rules, this is as good as he gets.

If he gets into power again it will not be the same as last time. \n\nIn 2016 the only thing I warned people about was the fact that if he got in he could stack the courts because justices were getting old and that could be a major issue.

The answer is none of them and they didn't know that so they were wholly unprepared to run a government. \n\nAnd the people who spend millions of dollars trying to get Republicans elected in order to you know change laws change precedent They saw that and they put themselves in positions to influence him and they've done so if you haven't researched project 2025 you should.

That is his biggest strength as a candidate. Talking to 2 journalists refusing to do any journalism right in front of him sucked his energy away.\n\nThe second issue is that he was too bogged down with talking points. It\'s no coincidence that ""you have the morals of an alley cat"" is the most memorable line of the night. Let Biden say what he\'s thinking, not what someone behind the scenes thinks he should say. It always works out better that way.\n\nIt\'s June 27th. It\'s not over. It was a bad night, but it\'s not doing anything for swing voters either way. Republicans are laughing, but they\'d never vote for him anyway. Democrats are melting down, but they will vote for him anyway. The undecideds aren\'t going to care what happened in June by November. Most of them probably still aren\'t paying attention.\n\nBiden has been an extremely successful president, especially when it comes to taking down the billionaire class and corporations, and most people don\'t know that. We\'d be hard pressed to find any mainstream democrat like him at this point, and if we don\'t re-elect him, all that is over. Dems will push back all progress and assume catering to the right is the way to go, which is what always happens when they lose. Biden\'s not perfect, but he\'s the best president anyone here has had in their life, and it\'s not just because that title is a low bar. It\'s because he\'s actually working for us. He doesn\'t set the prices, but he\'s doing his damndest to punish the people who do. No one else who could be president would do that.\n\nBill Clinton had a cool personality and all (I guess) but his policies seriously changed what people believe we can do. He made the party go on the path of pushing right anytime you lose, and then when you win, assume it was because you pushed right. Biden is finally pushing us forward again. It\'s hard to believe because he seems like a normie (and he definitely is in some ways, like reform the SCOTUS already, man!) but he was born as a normal person like all of us.

I wouldn’t say Trump performed well necessarily—that is, appearing presidential, trustworthy, or levelheaded—but he let Biden beat himself and did what Trump does best: Gish gallop and speak in generalities. He also used the format to ignore whatever the current question was and instead kept returning to follow up on Biden’s previous response. So he got extra time to respond to Biden while simultaneously not answering the question at hand. Trump exaggerated and made shit up and then he allowed Biden to be the one to offer specific details to counter Trump’s malarkey and when Biden took the bate, he essentially beat himself over and over by getting into the weeds, using incorrect statistics (I think at the beginning he said he created 15,000 jobs, when I think he meant 15,000,000--which I still don\'t know is accurate), meandering, pausing, and stumbling over his words. He came off as the old man he is, and I\'m wondering if Democrats are more concerned now about his ability to be POTUS for another four years or if they are most concerned with the politics of Republicans now being able to say loudly for the next few months, I told you so!  Biden kept listing things “Number 1,” “Number 2” and then he trailed off. In listing things in this way, he basically set himself up to look more forgetful than perhaps he really is like George Bush trying to remember the phrase: ""fool me once shame on . . . you fool me and you can\'t get fooled again!"" Biden interrupted himself, stepped on his own words without first finishing his thoughts, etc. The times Biden appeared strongest were when he went on the attack. Calling Trump a felon, an abuser of women, an adulterer, and a liar was powerful cause Trump is all of those things--pointing this out put Trump briefly on the defensive. Biden needed to be looking into the camera to the American people, saying things like, “Did you notice, he didn’t answer that question?” And, “Mr. Trump seems like he can\'t give a straight answer to your questions, Jake. I suppose he either doesn’t know how to solve issues impacting the American people or he just doesn\'t care, maybe both, but my administration has done the following.” Biden should have actively called out Trump’s behaviors and his shiftiness in avoiding basic questions from the moderators. Any time Biden started to talk numbers was problematic for him. He should have kept speaking generally about policies and the accomplishments of his administration to counter Trump’s debate strategy. I wish Biden would have said something to the effect of, “I hope the American people noticed there, Mr. Trump just discussed about five separate topics, none of which addressed your original question, Jake, but it sure sounded like something. He’s avoiding answering your questions because he has no solutions for the American people, only grievance politics and political boogeyman. The American people deserve solutions, not malarkey, and I have done the following and once re-elected intend to . . . ” I also heard very little from Biden about Republican dysfunction in Congress. They literally just put up a proposal that would defund federal prosecutors while the Right whines about Biden being anti-law and order. MGT talks about Jewish Space Lasers and imprisoning Dr. Fauci while Republicans in control of the power of the purse in the House, refuse to work with their Democratic colleagues to pass comprehensive immigration reform so they can cynically weaponize their own Congressional inaction against Biden in an election year--I did not hear Biden make this point. One of the worst debates overall I think I have ever seen and a C- performance from Biden, and that\'s probably being generous. He got slightly better as it went on, but not by much.

Yeah, the individual is important to a degree when voting, but it\'s more about what was done and how government ran, during that administration. Our government is about a collective whole, not individuals. \n\nThat\'s what concerns me about Trump compared to Biden. Trump wants to be more powerful, have more control, and essentially treat the presidency as if it were a position of royalty. Trump wants to be a king.\nBiden just wants a second term as president. \n\nBoth our old and incoherent half the time they are awake.

Trump and Biden BOTH had classified documents in their homes. Biden had no right to those documents because he was VP and never got in trouble even though he CLEARLY broke the law. Why can\'t we hold both candidates to the same standard?\n\nIn Trump\'s case, the National Archives tried for more than a year after Trump left office to retrieve all of the records he retained, without success. When Trump finally returned 15 boxes of documents in January 2022, Archives officials discovered they contained classified materials.\n\nThe matter was referred to the Justice Department, which issued a grand jury subpoena last May seeking the return of all classified records. Investigators then visited Trump\'s home, where his attorneys handed over more material and asserted there were no more documents on the premises.\n\nThat turned out to be false. Additional evidence collected by the FBI, including surveillance footage from the Mar-a-Lago estate, prompted agents to seek court approval to execute a search warrant on Aug. 8 amid concerns over possible obstruction.\n\nThe FBI recovered an additional 13,000 documents, about 100 of which were marked as classified.\n\nIn Biden\'s case, Garland said the president\'s attorneys informed the Archives and the Justice Department in November that they had discovered fewer than a dozen classified files inside a closet at the Penn Biden Center think tank in Washington D.C. earlier that month.\n\nAfter the discovery, the attorneys continued to conduct additional searches at Biden\'s homes in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where more documents were found in both December and this month. All were turned over to the authorities.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-vs-trump-what-is-difference-between-two-classified-records-cases-2023-01-12/\n\ntl;dr: If Trump had just given them back, he never would\'ve gotten in trouble.\n\n>Why not Trump? Seriously. Why not? Other than he\'s a racist (he\'s not), or anything about his CHARACTER.\n\nYou aren\'t willing to believe Trump did even one thing people wouldn\'t like other than ""lie"" about him being racist or say they dislike his character? Like you truly honestly believe there\'s *no reason* anyone would dislike his presidential policies and actions? Do you *really* believe every American has the exact same views as you and Trump? \n\nAs a very basic answer that I know you know already is the three people he appointed to SCOTUS.

I hate Trump, but I'm not gonna pretend that Biden is anything but a senile old man who never should have run for re-election."", 1], ['First, evidently it is Biden himself--Joe and Jill--that are  shooting down the increasing panic within the party.  The Democrats move like a runner made of granite when it comes to daring to question their scared cow Establishment heroes (Feinstein was literally 10 years past being completely senile and the Nancy Pelosis of the party were still protecting her completely incompetent tenure), but even they have been whispering for a while now.  If Biden doesn\'t step down, he WILL receive enough delegates at the convention--the delegates were basically chosen in the first place because they would coddle him unquestioningly, and no delegate wants to be the one that starts down the ""disloyal"" train, especially if he still ends up being the nominee.  If heavyweights like Obama can\'t dissuade Biden from running, and none of the other craven weasels (Newsom, for example) would dare present themselves as an alternative to him even though the primary was wide open, then there is no mechanism to make Biden listen to anyone, and he is definitely still delusional enough to think he can win.  Something something Soul of America until the night when the VOTES of America give Trump 344 EV\'s.\n\nThe Democrats\' problem goes so far beyond Biden\'s age and competence that I\'m not sure they can win with anyone anymore.  But given that Biden is trailing in several states where Dem Senators are leading, it is definitely fair to speculate that a replacement  could win.  Certainly a replacement would have a better chance, while Biden\'s chances tonight went from about 15% to 0% in my view.\n\nThey make it so hard for many reasons.  First, he is surrounded by people whose jobs are dependent upon Biden being president, so they are incentivized to keep propping him up even if he likely can\'t win--they\'re out of a job regardless, so they might as well take their chances.  Second, the corporate donors who run the party have always been fine with Biden, because he just protects the status quo.  They\'re also fine with Trump mostly, since they think that maybe they\'ll get their next round of corporate tax cuts without the market crashing, and if it does they\'ll just take their money and retire.  Those donors would much rather have a race where they can\'t lose (Trump v. Biden) than someone that has a chance to actually change something important or to empower the ordinary citizen.\n\nThird, they\'re out of ideas as a party.  Returning Roe is impossible, and even if they could it is just getting us back to where we just were.  Restoring ""democracy"" is also impossible, and they\'re almost singularly terrible at it too.  What is the rest of the inspiring agenda?  Trump\'s immigration stance, a corporate infrastructure bill and funding the slaughter of more Palestinian children?  Even a good candidate would have a hard time selling these miserable policies.  They make it hard because they care more about protecting a deeply unpopular status quo--and their own power--than about winning.  They don\'t really WANT the Democratic agenda they claim if it interferes with the bottom line of the donors, which it almost always does.\n\nSo that\'s how you end up a nearly incoherent 81-year-old that no one wants to run, with fascism at the door.  The party has corroded itself for 50 years and only a couple of generational talents--Clinton and Obama--have broken through to the public, and both despite what were usually hideous policies given with a smile instead of a Biden incoherent stutter.

The base wants to win, they feel it\'s important for the country.  The party leaders want to keep themselves in power at the top of the party.  If Republicans win, Dem leaders just go back to fundraising and finger-pointing, which is basically their job regardless.  If someone other than one of their Club insiders win, all of those terrible consultants and party bigwigs get fired.  They know that corporate Rightwing Dems like Hillary and Biden will rake in the money and keep everyone\'s gravy train rolling, so their energy goes to that, regardless of whether that person is well-suited to win.\n\nNobody who was in a position of privilege or power within the Democratic Establishment actually lost anything material by Trump\'s win.  So there was no lesson to learn.  If given a metaphysical CERTAINTY that Bernie would beat Trump, they\'d still have taken their chances with the deeply unpopular Hillary, because they hated and feared Progressive policies more than they hated Trump.  And still do.\n\nBut I also disagree that she that was ""mostly right"" or that she didn\'t do anything wrong.  I don\'t know how early you\'d like to go, but it was beyond obvious that she was a bad candidate--she got 93% of the party\'s endorsements, and ended up with 54% of the pledged delegates.  That\'s a horrible performance.  There were zero pundits on all of television that believed that Sanders could win 5 states, and he won 22 states.  When Rachel Maddow asked her how she would reach out to Bernie\'s voters and bring them back into the fold, her answer was not ""I\'m going to listen to them / I appreciate their commitment to their ideals / I\'ll work closely with Bernie to make sure that much of his dream is realized,"" it was ""I won.  They\'re supposed to vote for me now.""  In other words, ""F them, I\'m not going to do anything for them.""  She hired person after person that was an intentional slap in the face to the Left (Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, for example).  She presumed that she had the entire base locked up so much that she didn\'t bother listening to anyone about anything.  And all of this was before the general election.\n\nOn top of that, every policy that made Trump an unthinkable monster was something that she had a difficult time attacking him on, because she had said or done similar things in the past.  She had called for a border fence.  She had a significant assortment of lies and made-up stories (""sniper fire"") just like Trump did.  She was brutal to women (Monica) just like Trump was.  She had a major corruption problem (the Goldman Sachs speeches, for example).  It was hard to attack Trump on his racism when she had used the term Superpredators.  It was hard to attack him on his claims that the election would be rigged if he lost, because she had advocated for Israel to rig the 2006 Gaza elections.  It was hard to criticize Trump for his business practices when she had supported NAFTA and the Bankruptcy Bill and the TPP, which were all destroying the jobs in the cities.  It was hard to say that he\'d be a disaster for the environment when she had gone around the world promoting fracking.  It was hard to label him a Narcissist when one of her slogans was literally ""I\'m with her.""\n\nSo I don\'t think she was mostly right either.  I think she was incredibly flawed as a candidate (the whole time, even before adapting was necessary), she was deeply unpopular (she had a 40% approval rating. while running AGAINST DONALD TRUMP!!!!), and she had supported a ton of awful policies.  Trump ran against the system and the Establishment, and she represented both, and both were immensely despised by 2016.  They were despised by 2010, which is part of why after Obama won 365 EV\'s just 8 years before 2016, Hillary was struggling to barely get to 273 if she had won the Rust Belt states.

No amendment, including the first, is absolute when it comes to a clear and present danger for the society.

Attackers biggest hurdle is finding weaknesses in the defense, and finding weakness is done through probing.\n\nSo the rioters need not be practiced enough to be paramilitary experts to cause significant damage or destruction, they need only to be just competent enough to identify a weakness in the defense and the defense needs orders of magnitudes more resources to do prevent those weaknesses from being exploited. Granted there's one thing America is well known for which is funding its military and police forces generally speaking, but Trump seemingly has a fairly significant amount of ardent supporters. Fairly significant doesn't mean majority of people in the country of course, but still could be enough to overcome some of the defenses of the country. Granted no one is beating a military tank with a 9mm pistol, but that's again where practice and probing the defense matters.

They sold it in March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic for $8.14 million.[57][58] Also in March 2021, the couple jointly purchased a $9.7 million home in Jupiter, Florida.[59] Guilfoyle and Trump became engaged on December 31, 2020.

They gain attention, win over voters, build momentum, and eventually capture more votes than they started with.\n\nRunning a successful campaign depends on a national network of volunteers (which Bernie had built with grassroots recruitment, vs getting the benefit of the loyal party network developed over generations) and on the relationships with media and political operators we might call a ""machine,"" who endorse, and strategically manipulate the gears of their governmental influence to raise the profile of favorable issues at the right time, create beneficial local/regional press opportunities for their allies, etc. \n\nThe power of the Party is no joke, even if the Democratic Party often appears as lost and feeble as Biden did last night. \n\nThey recognized that Bernie was on track to win that primary if the field continued to compete for even another couple of weeks (which they had every reason to do, based on early results) without consolidating behind a single candidate and throwing all the weight of the machine behind him. \n\nIf Buttigieg and Klobuchar hadn\'t dropped when they did (and Pete\'s win in Iowa gave him plenty of reason not to, Amy\'s numbers were a bit less optimistic, but she still had some hope of gaining ground if she stayed in), Bernie would have won Super Tuesday in a landslide, and that narrative would have forced all that machine power to shift behind him. \n\nEven when the Party brokered that deal with Pete and Amy to drop out and endorse Biden in exchange for a cabinet seat and a promise of massive fundraising for their future races, if Warren had also dropped out exactly when they did, instead of fighting for Super Tuesday and splitting some of the more independent minded vote, Bernie would have won Super Tuesday in a landslide and, again, gone on to win the nomination.\n\nIt took the combined power of every conventional party member colluding, and the awe-inspiring power of Jim Clyburn and his influence single-handedly throwing SC and most of the South behind Biden (go look up the survey results of AA Primary Dem voters in those states, like 68% of them identified him as the reason for their Biden vote, holy shit that\'s power) and the activation of 3-5 candidate\'s networks, the divisive impact of Warren remaining in, and the assistance of major media outlets to get out the vote and give Biden enough boost to win a majority of states on Super Tuesday and change the narrative. Biden was essentially dead in the water until that point. \n\nYou\'re going to say, but all those voters chose him over Bernie?
