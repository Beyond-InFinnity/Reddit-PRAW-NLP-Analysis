The strike was among the heaviest attacks on the capital since Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Twenty-two people were killed in the capital, including two staff members at the hospital, where three children were hurt. At least 36 people were killed across Ukraine. The Ukrainian president posted on the Telegram messaging app: “Russia cannot help but know where its missiles are flying, and must fully answer for all its crimes: against people, against children, against humanity in general.”\n\n>After the strikes, US president Joe Biden promised “new measures” to boost Ukraine’s air defences. “Russia’s missile strikes that today killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians and caused damage and casualties at Kyiv’s largest children’s hospital are a horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. He was speaking on the eve of a Nato summit in Washington where leaders are expected to present a\xa0“historic” aid package\xa0for Ukraine, including air defences. Observers expect Nato members to pledge at least four additional Patriot missile batteries. Zelenskiy had previously asked Nato for seven batteries, saying that Putin “must be brought down to earth, and our sky must become safe again … And it depends fully on your choice … [the] choice whether we are indeed allies.”\n\n>Western and UN leaders condemned Monday’s strikes, which saw Ukraine’s main treatment centre for children with cancer, take a direct missile hit. British prime minister Keir Starmer condemned “attacking innocent children” as the “most depraved of actions”, while the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, called the missile strike a “war crime”. A spokesperson for António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he strongly condemned the “particularly shocking” strikes against the children’s hospital and another medical facility. UN rights chief Volker Türk condemned the Russian strikes as “abominable”. France’s foreign ministry called the bombardment of a children’s hospital “barbaric” and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau described the attack as “abhorrent”. Russia has claimed the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defence systems and that it was striking only military targets.\n\n>Witnesses in Kyiv have described how children – some as young as 18 months old and suffering kidney problems – had to be hurriedly taken off dialysis and evacuated\xa0through the building’s windows\xa0after the missile strike on Okhmatdyt children’s hospital. Nurse Tanya Lapshina said the strike came at a time when the hospital was at its busiest, and she feared for a child who was undergoing open-heart surgery at the time. Lapshina said her ward managed to bring the children to the shelter just minutes before the strike. “It was absolute chaos. The children were panicked, crying in the bunker. There are no words for this. It’s awful. I’m still shaking.” Images from inside the hospital, which treats 20,000 patients annually, showed bloodied children, collapsed ceilings and destroyed operating rooms.\n\n>The UN security council is to meet on Tuesday\xa0at the request of Britain, France, Ecuador, Slovenia and the US.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/09/ukraine-war-briefing-day-of-mourning-in-kyiv-after-missile-strike-on-childrens-hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/09/ukraine-war-briefing-day-of-mourning-in-kyiv-after-missile-strike-on-childrens-hospital)', 50], ['So even after Russia deiliberatery attacks hospital with cancer children and other hospitals, restriction to attack Russian airfields on farther distance with ATACMS  , not gonna be lifted?

Payments are only now accepted at the local post office.  Since there’s multiple villages without post offices but did have running water, now those villages won’t be getting water.\n\nThe water comptroller for occupied Zaporizhye region said that he wasn’t opposed to allowing online payments, but that this order for exclusively in-person payments was coming ‘from above.’  This blame-shifting led the reporter for *Ria-Melitopol* to close with this:\n\n> This new method of payment for water service is undoubtedly a way for the occupiers to continue determining which are the unoccupied houses and apartments—because many evacuated Melitopol residents continued to pay utility bills monthly, even via their friends, so as not to attract attention to their property and the Russians subsequently deem the property ‘ownerless.’  A similar situation is now occurring in the villages of the Berdyansk region.', 41], ['Donations have poured in to help rebuild the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, one of the largest in Europe and provided treatment for various diseases including cancer.

However, according to a high-ranking European arms industry source, the current capacity is about one-third of this.\n\n>""It\'s a very bad idea to convince ourselves that we have three times the actual production capacity and make decisions based on that.

Production increases across Europe are lagging behind, with the current total capacity reaching about 580,000 shells per year,"" said a well-informed artillery industry source from Slovakia.\n\n>Two other documents estimate the European industry\'s annual capacity as of the beginning of the year at not much higher than half a million.\n\n>According to a December 2023 Estonian Defense Ministry report, the EU production capacity is about 600,000 shells a year. This fits with German arms maker Rheinmetall\'s January 2024 estimate, an internal document that journalists obtained, which says that all Western European arms makers taken together could produce around 550,000 shells annually as of the beginning of this year.\n\nLong term contracts are still not being made:\n\n>Even so, NAMMO is risking investing in capacity expansion.

According to Colonel Mikko Millikangas , the top manager responsible for relations with the main customer of the company - the Finnish armed forces, the company will invest 200 million euros in its Finnish facilities alone.\n\n>Other European manufacturers interviewed by journalists also claim that they are gradually increasing investments in their own capacities, despite the lack of government contracts.\n\nNot all projectiles produced in the EU are sent to Ukraine:\n\n>EU countries keep ammunition for themselves.

The woman who was supposed to have done it was actually turned into a horrible abomination and she now is the very first boss you face in theatre, the people hero, killing all who enter immediately. But the story prevails, no one who enters is able to tell anyone outside how impossible the task is, and so the taste of hope remains, and every day more people throw themselves at this hope with no chance of ever winning. \n\nThe whole thing is an allegory for the rich. They convince regular folks that they could make it to the top. If you just tried a little harder, worked a little more, have as little fun as possible, you too one day could be super rich. \n\nBecoming super rich in the real world is technically achievable, but that’s why the Taste of Hope is so effective. All of the poorest conservatives genuinely believe if they make their boss super rich it will somehow make them super rich. They feel like those bosses and landlords “earned” that money. They “deserve it. And they think that stuff not because they actually believe it, but because if they were ever to finally break through and become rich, they would want to horde all that wealth for themselves just like the people who currently have money. They don’t want rich people to have consequences, because they genuinely believe one day that might be rich, and they wouldn’t want to have to deal with all those pesky rules and consequences if they were in the rich shoes.

Do me a favor and look into the post WWII progressives who went so far anti Nazi, they created state sponsored pedophilia, where abandoned and orphaned children were placed with caregivers the authorities knew full well were diddling them. Read some of the accounts of adults who knew full well they didn’t like diddling children, but did so because it was a leftist and progressive action and anti-Nazi, because sexual freedom is anti Nazi.

I bet using plastic for everything was really progressive in the 1960s. Hell until the early 1990s in school we were encouraged to use plastic in our “progressive” recycling education programs, because it could be reused and was less resource intensive than other cleaner greener materials. \n\nThe entire point of my argument is that the 2 sides are supposed to serve equal and opposite functions in a healthy society. Progressives push for change and to move society forward while conservatives are more wait and see and steer the course. As an analogy, progressives are the sail to a sail boat while conservatives are the rudder. Both are as important as the other and serve a function that can’t be complete without each other. \n\n\nBeing “progressive” isn’t inherently a good thing on its own if you don’t have an actual platform you are rallying for, it ends up spinelessly sending children to pedophiles and littering plastic everywhere for progress for the sake of progress, which is not an inherently good thing. \n\nBtw I am also a progressive, but your whole “shun them under a rock” and response reading like your class just finished reading the communist manifesto is wholly inaccurate and dangerous.

Preparation\n\nThe victims are identified, separated, and forced to wear symbols. Deportations, isolation, and forcible starvation.

Persecution (isolation of victims based on nationality, ethnic group or religion, victims might be forced to wear specific symbols, that process is ongoing in the occupied territories and Ukrainians are subject to massive repression especially when they refuse to be russified)\n\n9.

Experts rightly stated it was a poor long term strategy because the interception rate was above 80% consistently and they seldom hit significant military targets (unless you count women and kids as both ""soldier makers"" and ""future soldiers"" respectively, then I guess you could say that Russia has hit *swathes* of ""military targets"".)\n\nThere were two unlikely but common place viewpoints on the matter. It was either A.) Russia is gonna use up all their missiles in just 2 years! And B.) Russia seems to keep shooting missiles, Russia will never run out/is producing plenty! Both statements are sorta of true. Initially, the rate of missile use *would have* completely drained their stockpile in a couple years or less. But also, Russia is still not out of missiles. But that doesn\'t mean nothing changed.\n\nA Military at a grand scale has thousands of managing elements, even in the most incompetent armies. The most basic concept of logistics at this scale is that \n\n1.) you cannot spend your entire stockpile. This is suicide and guarantees your eventual defeat. Armies aren\'t defeated to the last bullet and man. Armies lose the ability to fight back effectively and an inevitability dictates a change in strategy to being on the backfoot, to routing, to outright surrender. A common generalized number for attrition that renders a combat unit ineffective (Meaning it simply cannot achieve any tactical goal beyond self-preservation actions) is around 15%. That may seem low, but consider if a sixth of the staff of where you work was fired, would you only perform 15% less effective, or would having the other 4/5ths cover their own responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of that fired 6th employee render you a little more than just 15% less effective? Missing personnel and resources has an exponential compounding effect, not a directly linear one.\n\nAnd 2.) logistics is reactive. If you are running low on a crucial battlefield resource, you use less of it, conserving it for important operations and the most relevant sectors at the moment. A war is won and lost months to years before, when the resources and manpower were allocated and the acceptable attritional rates were established. A war might look like it is defined by a single battle, but that is simply the consequence of months to years of the grand strategy put into place. Like high level chess, operational strategy can be summarized to being a game of recognizing the signs of the opponents intentions, recognizing feints and producing your own, and anticipating their actions weeks to months in advance, while tricking the opponent to committing resources to a fruitless or wholly counterproductive strategy. Both sides are anticipating a scenario where the other wastes more resources than themselves, and it\'s this number that the actions from the tactical level to the operational level seek to affect: reduce the enemy\'s resources faster than your own, so that the decisive moment *can* be reached. Therefore Russia using 100% of it\'s missiles wouldn\'t be the moment the war turns in Ukraine\'s favor, it\'s the moment some point after the war has already ended.\n\nSo both camps are right, Russia is running out of missiles, AND Russia will not run out of missiles. There is simply not a reality where Russia expends every last missile, Tank, and bullet. But they do use *less*, and using less is awfully similar to using none if your opponent can use more.\n\nIt is without refute that Russian missile strikes have slowed from the weekly 100 missile strikes in the first months of the war, to weekly 50 missile strikes, to slowing down to it\'s first lull in the Fall of 2022 where it turned into small handfuls, with the 100 missile strikes turning into a once or twice a season event., followed by more months of decreased activity, and the gradual transition to relying on less effective, but more cost friendly, long range drone attacks.\n\nThis overly-explained concept can be applied to Russian financial reserves. They won\'t ever use *all* of their money, they\'ll just use less over time, accepting more and more cost-saving measures, trimming more fat, and gradually stripping every facet of Russian life, from food, to shelter, to amenities, to its most basic necessities. Yes Russia could technically *survive* on nutrient paste, but it doesn\'t do well for internal morale and war support, and would be indicative of a war already lost if Ukraine isn\'t too also reduced to food paste.\n\nIt will not come down to the last penny, the last missile, or the last body for Russia to lose, nor will it likely even come close to 30% expenditure. It will happen at some point in between as resources are juggled between crucial sectors, and a tolerance point is crossed. And this cumulative moment of the war will have already been decided well before this tolerance point is crossed. Yes, this doesn\'t account for outside interference, changing the course of the war, but even that kind of geopolitical game can be measured and predicted to an extent.\n\nI\'d personally argue we reached this point in favor of Ukraine, and we are witnessing the long, drawn out thrashing of a dying empire lying to itself that it will pull a wild card. Taking all this into account, you can see why the territory Russia gains doesn\'t matter as much as the many independently sourced and calculated graphs showing Russia consistently losing material resources at 2-5x the rate of Ukraine.
