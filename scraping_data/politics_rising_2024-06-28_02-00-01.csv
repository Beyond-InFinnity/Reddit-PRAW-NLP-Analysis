Less than an hour into it, various Democratic members of Congress and their staff were frantically messaging each other, panicking about the very real possibility of a second Trump administration and asking one another if there’s any way that Biden can be replaced as the party’s nominee by the Chicago convention in August.\n\nNine sources across the Democratic elite — lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill, longtime party operatives, moneymen, and even current Biden officials — watched the debate in horror, and relayed their candid assessments and visceral panic to Rolling Stone in real time. All feared Biden’s performance at the debate could help hand the federal government back to an increasingly authoritarian and openly corrupt Trump and his MAGA zealots. Each one conceded it might be best if the sitting president were not the 2024 nominee, and wondered if, as one Democratic lawmaker put it, an “intervention” should be staged as soon as possible to push the White House to get Biden to step aside.\n\nAccording to written communications reviewed by Rolling Stone and two sources familiar with the matter, as the Biden-Trump debate was ongoing, several Democratic lawmakers and numerous staffers on Capitol Hill were feverishly venting to one another that Biden should not be the party’s pick to face Trump on Election Day in November, and that intra-party pressure should immediately be applied to determine a successor.\n\nRead more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/democrats-panic-over-bidens-debate-performance-1235048536/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/democrats-panic-over-bidens-debate-performance-1235048536/)"", 1], ['Don\'t understand why some people still say this is ""dooming,"" It was an unmitigated disaster tonight.', 1], ['It’s depressing but it doesn’t change my vote.

This is something that has been a part of births for thousands of years, and is an incredibly difficult decision to make, but it’s one that *doctors, caregivers, and the family should have a say in*, not politicians.

They saved me because they determined they could and should while also giving my mother a choice, which is what everyone should want.

Mothers love their children, and to assume otherwise is an insult to the pain and process of bearing a child. my mom trusted the doctors and they tried to save me, as they should. Due to their skill and sound judgement, my mother survived as well. This is *why they are doctors/professionals*. If it was certain that I would die, then they should try to save my mom.
