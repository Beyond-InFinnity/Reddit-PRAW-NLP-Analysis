I\'m not sure how or why anyone reading my comments would think I\'m not critical of Cannon.\n\nI pointed out that she hasn\'t done anything outside of what she\'s allowed to do as a judge though, which is why it\'s not obstruction of justice and why Jack Smith doesn\'t have anything to use try to get her removed. It turns out gaming the system (or just delaying the case) isn\'t a crime if you\'re not actually breaking laws, no matter how frustrating it might be and how much upset people on reddit wish it was. \n\nI pointed out that engaging in conspiratorial thinking (such as she must be receiving instructions from above) is the same as when the right is saying the Bidens are a crime family despite all the supposed crimes being provably made up lies. It\'s hypocritical, and it\'s not ok just because it\'s being used against \'the other side\'. If it\'s wrong for the right to do it, it\'s also wrong for the left. It\'s one thing to raise doubts or questions, or point out her Federalist Society getaway and think she\'s biased. It\'s one thing to read in the obvious motives of her clear delaying tactics. But to assert your idle, evidence free speculation of her engaging in a criminal conspiracy as fact is precisely the same as the Biden investigations and allegations.\n\nI also pointed out that some of her actions in Trump\'s case fit her typical M.O. for managing her cases, [as explained by attorneys who have had cases in her court.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/aileen-cannon-judge-trump-classified-documents/index.html) That doesn\'t mean she isn\'t intentionally delaying things, or isn\'t biased in favor of Trump (Occam\'s Razor could only lead a reasonable person to think thats true, regardless of her track record). But it is relevant and interesting information, and provides some insight into Cannon\'s decision making.', 1], ['So you draw the line at people not clarifying that what they are saying is their perspective?
