No Presidential candidate in recent memory has ever pandered to all the fringe nut job groups out there.

They know he’s awful for the country, for the environment, everything else, but they don’t care because greed wins every time and Trump is better for their bank account.\n\nNext you have all the people that have agendas that they know they can push through if Trump wins. Trumps middle name is quid pro quo. So everyone that has been looking for a President to buy over the last several decades has found by far their best opportunity. Trump is too busy watching TV all day to deal with pesky policy decisions, so the people that have managed to complement him the most, and therefore get cushy govt positions in his administration, are able to push through whatever they’re getting paid to push through.  \n\n2 out of 3 of these groups likely don’t even like Trump.

Do me a favor and look into the post WWII progressives who went so far anti Nazi, they created state sponsored pedophilia, where abandoned and orphaned children were placed with caregivers the authorities knew full well were diddling them. Read some of the accounts of adults who knew full well they didn’t like diddling children, but did so because it was a leftist and progressive action and anti-Nazi, because sexual freedom is anti Nazi.

I bet using plastic for everything was really progressive in the 1960s. Hell until the early 1990s in school we were encouraged to use plastic in our “progressive” recycling education programs, because it could be reused and was less resource intensive than other cleaner greener materials. \n\nThe entire point of my argument is that the 2 sides are supposed to serve equal and opposite functions in a healthy society. Progressives push for change and to move society forward while conservatives are more wait and see and steer the course. As an analogy, progressives are the sail to a sail boat while conservatives are the rudder. Both are as important as the other and serve a function that can’t be complete without each other. \n\n\nBeing “progressive” isn’t inherently a good thing on its own if you don’t have an actual platform you are rallying for, it ends up spinelessly sending children to pedophiles and littering plastic everywhere for progress for the sake of progress, which is not an inherently good thing. \n\nBtw I am also a progressive, but your whole “shun them under a rock” and response reading like your class just finished reading the communist manifesto is wholly inaccurate and dangerous.
